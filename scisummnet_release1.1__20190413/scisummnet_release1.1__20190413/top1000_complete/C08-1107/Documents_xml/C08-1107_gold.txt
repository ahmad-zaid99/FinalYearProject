using binary rules for inference is not enough.
We are further motivated by the fact thatsome (mostly supervised) works in IE found learn ing unary templates useful for recognizing relevant named entities (Riloff, 1996; Sudo et al, 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2006), though they did notattempt to learn generic knowledge bases of entail ment rules.This paper investigates acquisition of unary entailment rules from regular non-comparable cor pora
The first ap proach directly assesses the relation between twogiven templates based on the similarity of their in stantiations in the corpus.
The second approach,which was also mentioned in (Iftene and Balahur Dobrescu, 2007), derives unary rules from learned binary rules.
we chose the structure of unary templates to be paths as well, where oneend of the path is the template?s variable.
How ever, paths with one variable have more expressive power than paths between two variables, since the combination of two unary paths may generate a binary template that is not a path.
whenever a verb is encountered we generate templates that are paths between v and the verb?s modifiers, either ob jects, prepositional complements or infinite or gerund verb forms (paths ending at stop words, e.g. pronouns, are not generated).
We use the Catvar database to identify verb derivations (Habash and Dorr, 2003).
