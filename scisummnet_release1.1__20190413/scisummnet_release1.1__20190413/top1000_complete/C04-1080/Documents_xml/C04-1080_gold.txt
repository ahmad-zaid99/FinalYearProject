In order to build both left and right-context into an HMM part-of-speech tagger, we reformulate the Figure 1: Graphical Structure of Traditional HMM Tagger (top) and Contextualized HMM Tagger (bottom) trigram HMM model traditionally described as ? = ???
Given that we are using an increased context size during the estimation of lexical probabilities, thus fragmenting the data, we have found it desirable to smooth these estimates, for which we use a standard absolute discounting scheme (Ney, Essen and Knesser, 1994)
For our comparison of unsupervised tagging methods, we implemented the HMM taggers described in Merialdo (1991) and Kupiec (1992), as well as the UTBL tagger described in Brill (1995).
The algorithms were trained and tested using version 3 of the Penn Treebank, using the training, development, and test split described in Collins (2002) and also employed by Toutanova et al (2003) in testing their supervised tagging algorithm.
Specifically, we allocated sections 00 18 for training, 19-21 for development, and 22-24 for testing.
One issue we noticed which impacted tagging accuracy was that of a frequently occurring word (a) The/VB Lyneses/NNP ,/, of/IN Powder/NNP Springs/NNP ,/, Ga./NNP ,/, have/VBP filed/VBN suit/NN in/IN Georgia/NNP state/NN court/NN against/IN Stuart/NNP James/NNP ,/, *-1/-NONE- alleging/VBG fraud/NN ./.

''/'' (c) a/SYM -/: Discounted/VBN rate/NN ./.
That is, tags that appeared the tag of a particular word less than X% of the time were omitted from the set of possible tags for that word.

This approach is similar to that described in Ratnaparhki (1998), who used unambiguous phrasal attachments to train an unsupervised prepositional phrase attachment model.
We implemented this technique for the Kupiec, Merialdo and Contextualized HMM taggers.
From our training data, we were able to extract data for on the order of 10,000 unique unambiguous tag sequences which were then be used for better initializing the state transition probabilities.
As shown in Table 2, this method improved tagging accuracy of the Merialdo and contextual taggers over traditional simultaneous HMM training, reducing error by 0.4 in the case of Merialdo and 0.7 for the contextual HMM part-of-speech tagger.

The best result for this tagger, at 97.24%, makes use of both lexical and tag features coming from the left and right sides of the target.
As shown in Table 3, incorporating more context into an HMM when estimating lexical probabilities improved accuracy from 95.87% to 96.59%, relatively reducing error rate by 17.4%.
