Strongly Dα-closed graph

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  In this paper, a new kind of sets called Dα-open sets are introduced and studied in a topological spaces. The class of all Dα-open sets is strictly between the class of all α-open sets and g-open sets. Also, as applications we introduce and study Dα-continuous, Dα-open, and Dα-closed functions between topological spaces. Finally, some properties of Dα-closed and strongly Dα-closed graphs are investigated.
               

Generalized open sets play a very important role in General Topology, and they are now the research topics of many topologies worldwide. Indeed a significant theme in General Topology and Real Analysis is the study of variously modified forms of continuity, separation axioms, etc. by utilizing generalized open sets. One of the most well-known notions and also inspiration source are the notion of α-open [1] sets introduced by Njåstad in 1965 and generalized closed (g-closed) subset of a topological space [2] introduced by Levine in 1970. Since then, many mathematicians turned their attention to the generalization of various concepts in General Topology by considering α-open sets [3–10] and generalized closed sets [11–13]. In 1982 Dunham [14] used the generalized closed sets to define a new closure operator, and thus a new topology τ*, on the space, and examined some of the properties of this new topology.

                      and (Z, ν) denote topological spaces (briefly X, Y and Z) and no separation axioms are assumed on the spaces unless explicitly stated. For a subset A of a space (X, τ), Cl(A) and Int(A) denote the closure and the interior of A, respectively. Since we require the following known definitions, notations, and some properties, we recall in this section.

                                    A is generalized closed (briefly g-closed) [2] if Cl(A) ⊆ U whenever A ⊆ U and U is open in X.


                                    A is generalized open(briefly g-open) [2] if X\A is g-closed.

The α-closure of a subset A of X 
                           [3] is the intersection of all α-closed sets containing A and is denoted by Clα
                           (A). The α-interior of a subset A of X 
                           [3] is the union of all α-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Intα
                           (A). The intersection of all g-closed sets containing A 
                           [14] is called the g-closure of A and denoted by Cl*(A), and the g-interior of A 
                           [15] is the union of all g-open sets contained in A and is denoted by Int*(A).

We need the following notations:

                                    αO(X) (resp. αC(X)) denotes the family of all α-open sets (resp. α-closed sets) in (X, τ).

In this section we introduce Dα-closed sets and investigate some of their basic properties.
                        Definition 2.1
                        A subset A of a space X is called Dα-closed if 
                              
                                 C
                                 l

The collection of all Dα-closed sets in X is denoted by DαC(X).
                        Lemma 2.2
                        If there exists an g-closed set F such that 
                              
                                 C

                           , then A is Dα-closed.

Since F is g-closed, Cl*(F)  = F. Therefore,

If a subset A is Dα-closed and B is α-closed, then A ∩ B is Dα-closed.

Follows from Theorem 2.5 (i) and Theorem 2.8.

If a subset A is Dα-closed and F is g-closed, then A ∩ F is Dα-closed.

                        Definition 3.1
                        A subset A of a space X is called an Dα-open if X \ A is Dα-closed. Let DαO(X) denote the collection of all an Dα-open sets in X.

Let A ⊆ X, then

Let (X, τ) be a topological space. Then

                                 Every α-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.

Every g-open subset of (X, τ) is Dα-open.

From Theorem 2.5, the proof is obvious.

The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7, where

If a subset A is Dα-open and B is α-open, then A ∪ B is Dα-open.

If a subset A is Dα-open and U is g-open, then A ∪ U is Dα-open.

In this section we introduce Dα-continuous functions and investigate some of their basic properties.
                        Definition 4.1
                        A function f : X → Y is called Dα-continuous if the inverse image of each open set in Y is Dα-open in X.


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 Every α-continuous function is Dα-continuous.

Every g-continuous function is Dα-continuous.

It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    Dα-continuous function need not be α-continuous.

(see Example 4.4 (i) below)


                                    Dα-continuous function need not be g-continuous.

                        Theorem 4.5
                        Let f : X → Y be a function. Then the following are equivalent:


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    f is Dα-continuous.

For each x ∈ X and each open set V ⊂ Y containing f(x), there exists Dα-open set W ⊂ X containing x such that f(W) ⊂ V.

The inverse image of each closed set in Y is Dα-closed in X.

In this section we introduce Dα-open functions and Dα-closed functions and investigate some of their basic properties.
                        Definition 5.1
                        A function f : X → Y is said to be Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) if the image of each open (resp. closed) set in X is Dα-open (resp. Dα-closed) in Y.


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 Every α-open function is Dα-open.

Every g-open function is Dα-open.

It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 
                                    Dα-open function need not be α-open.

(see Example 5.4 below)


                                    Dα-open function set need not be g-open.

(i)⇒(iv) From (ii).

A topological space (X,τ) is said to be Dα-T
                           1 if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα-open U in X containing x but not y and an Dα-open V in X containing y but not x.


                           
                              
                                 (i)
                                 Every α-T
                                    1 space is Dα-T
                                    1.

Every g-T
                                    1 space is Dα-T
                                    1.

It is obvious from Theorem 3.6.

The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.

Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T

                           1.

Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T
                           1.

It readily follows from Corollary 6.9 and Theorem 6.10.

A topological space (X, τ) is said to be Dα-T
                           2 if for any distinct pair of points x and y in X, there exist Dα-open sets U and V in X containing x and y, respectively, such that U ∩ V = ϕ.

                                 Every α-T
                                    2 space is Dα-T
                                    2.

Every g-T
                                    2 space is Dα-T
                                    2.

Obvious.

The converse of the above theorem is not true as seen from Example 2.7.

Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) Dα-closed. Then Y is g-T

A strongly Dα-closed graph is Dα-closed. That the converse is not true is seen from Example 6.3, where 
                              
                                 {
                                 y
                                 }
                                 ∈
                                 G
                                 O
                                 (
                                 Y
                                 ,
                                  
                                 y
                                 )
                              
                            but 
                              
                                 {
                                 y
                                 }
                                 ∉
                                 O
                                 (
                                 Y
                                 )
                              
                           . Therefore G(f) is Dα-closed but not strongly Dα-closed.

Evidently every strongly α-closed graph (resp. strongly closed graph) is strongly Dα-closed graph. That the converse is not true is seen from the following example.

Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is T

Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.8 and T
                           1-ness always guarantees α-T
                           1-ness. Hence Y is α-T

Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is Dα-T

Follows From Theorems 6.6 (i) and 6.24.

Let f : X → Y be any injective with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then X is Dα-T

Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.10.

Let f : X → Y be any bijection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then both X and Y are Dα-T

It readily follows from Corollary 6.25 and Theorem 6.26.

Let f : X → Y be any surjection with G(f) strongly Dα-closed. Then Y is T

Similar to the proof Theorem 6.15 and T
                           2-ness always guarantees α-T
                           2-ness. Hence Y is α-T
                           2.
