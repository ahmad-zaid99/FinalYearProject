@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  Different lifting analysis tools are commonly used to assess spinal loads and risk of injury. Distinct musculoskeletal models with various degrees of accuracy are employed in these tools affecting thus their relative accuracy in practical applications. The present study aims to compare predictions of six tools (HCBCF, LSBM, 3DSSPP, AnyBody, simple polynomial, and regression models) for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression and shear loads in twenty-six static activities with and without hand load. Significantly different spinal loads but relatively similar patterns for the compression (R
                     2 > 0.87) were computed. Regression models and AnyBody predicted intradiscal pressures in closer agreement with available in vivo measurements (RMSE ≈ 0.12 MPa). Due to the differences in predicted spinal loads, the estimated risk of injury alters depending on the tool used. Each tool is evaluated to identify its shortcomings and preferred application domains.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Epidemiological studies have identified manual material handling and lifting as risk factors in occupational low back pain (LBP) (Garg and Moore, 1992; Hoogendoorn et al., 2000; Manchikanti, 2000; Thiese et al., 2014; Van Nieuwenhuyse et al., 2004). Modelling studies that predict increased compression, shear and moment loads on intervertebral discs (Arjmand and Shirazi-Adl, 2006) along with in vivo investigations that measure higher intradiscal pressures (Nachemson, 1981; Wilke et al., 2001), give support to and identify likely mechanisms for this association. To help manage the risk of work-related LBP, practitioners in occupational biomechanics use different tools to evaluate risk of injury to the spine during lifting activities. The 1991 NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) Lifting Equation (Waters et al., 1993) recommends weight limits that almost all healthy workers may handle without an increased risk of LBP.

On the other hand, there are a number of lifting tools that directly estimate spinal loads using biomechanical modelling techniques with different degrees of complexity; the University of Michigan's 3D Static Strength Prediction Program™ (3DSSPP) software (University of Michigan Center for Ergonomics, 2014), the revised Hand-Calculation Back Compressive Force (HCBCF) equation (Merryweather et al., 2009), the Linked-Segment Biomechanical Model (LSBM) (Potvin, 1997), the simple polynomial equation of low back compression (McGill et al., 1996), the Anybody Modelling System (AnyBody Technology, Aalborg, Denmark) (Damsgaard et al., 2006), and the regression models of Arjmand et al. (2011, 2012, 2013). As expected, the underlying assumptions and simplifications made in these tools influence the accuracy of their predictions and hence their applicability in ergonomic, rehabilitation, and biomechanical applications.

For instance, modelling studies often estimate muscle forces and spinal loads based on the balance of net external moments at a single lumbar level (3DSSPP, HCBCF equation, and LSBM). Such consideration of equilibrium, however, yields results in violation of equilibrium at remaining spinal levels (especially so in more physically demanding tasks) (Arjmand et al., 2007, 2009; 2010). Also, earlier models have made simplifications (e.g., on the trunk geometry, muscle anatomy and line of action, passive ligamentous properties, and gravity load distribution) that could adversely influence the accuracy of predictions (Arjmand, 2006; Arjmand et al., 2006). Moreover, some tools have inherent errors due to their regression technique (assumed equations in simple polynomial, regression models, and LSBM) while others may not be as easy to use thus requiring some user training (3DSSPP and AnyBody software). No comparative investigation of the differences in the estimated spinal loads by these tools during various lifting tasks has hitherto been carried out.

Hence, the present study aims to compare predictions (L4-L5 and L5-S1 segmental compressive and anterior–posterior shear loads) of the foregoing six lifting analysis tools when applied to identical manual load holding (static lifting) activities in upright and flexed, symmetric and asymmetric, and one- and two-handed conditions. Here, we intend to: 1) assess their respective underlying assumptions, 2) determine differences in the estimated spinal loads, 3) identify the accuracy of each tool in light of the comparison of its predicted compression forces with available in vivo intradiscal pressure measurements, and finally 4) their preferred domains of application. It is hypothesized that the estimates of spinal loads produced by the various tools will show large differences. The current comparative study should benefit researchers in various disciplines dealing with the biomechanical modelling, assessment of risk of occupational injuries, workplace performance improvement, and rehabilitation management.

@&#METHODS@&#

Twenty-six static activities in upright and flexed postures during symmetric and asymmetric loads and postures using one- and two-handed lifting techniques are considered. Spine loads at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are estimated by lifting analysis tools while assuming an identical body weight of 68.4 kg and height of 174.5 cm of a healthy male subject (Arjmand et al., 2009, 2010). These include 16 symmetric and 6 asymmetric static activities as follows (Fig. 1
                        ): 1) relaxed upright posture with no load in the hands located at ∼15 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc, 2–3) holding 19.8 kg at 25 cm or 55 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc in the upright posture, 4) flexing forward by 50° with hands at ∼25 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc, 5) flexing forward by 70° while holding 19.8 kg in hands at 32 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc, 6) peak voluntary flexion at 110° with hands 40 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc, 7–8) asymmetric one-handed lifts of 19.8 kg once on the left and then on the right side at ∼34 cm lateral and 0 cm posterior to the L5-S1 disc in the upright posture, 9–12) holding symmetrically a total of 19.8 kg (9.9 kg in each hand) with arms on sides and hands at 0 cm anterior to and ∼34, 70, 85, and 81 cm lateral to the L5-S1 disc (corresponding to ∼13, 50, 90, and 110° abduction of arms, respectively), 13–18) holding 17 kg symmetrically at a constant horizontal distance of 23 cm and vertical distances of respectively 25, 53, 81, 108, 137, and 165 cm to the ankle (corresponding to anterior load positions of ∼38, 44, 30, 30, 30, and 30 cm to the L5-S1 disc and forward trunk flexion angles of ∼80, 40, 13, 0, 0, and 0°) (Russell et al., 2007), 19–20) twisting the trunk by 30° to the right and to the left while holding 19.8 kg at 42 cm anterior and 21 cm lateral to the L5-S1, 21) flexing symmetrically forward by 70° while holding a load of 19.8 kg asymmetrically at 41 cm anterior and 33 cm right lateral to the L5-S1 disc, and finally 22) bending forward by 70° and laterally to the right by 20° while holding a load of 19.8 kg asymmetrically at 38 cm anterior and 47 cm right lateral to the L5-S1 disc. In addition, in order to investigate the sensitivity of each tool's response to variations in the magnitude of the hand load, simulations of task 2 (load handling symmetrically at 25 cm anterior to the L5-S1 disc in the upright posture) are repeated with 0, 25, 50, and 75% of 19.8 kg in hands (i.e., 0, 4.95, 9.9, 14.85 kg).

Corresponding body postures, i.e., trunk and pelvis rotations for a given load position, are determined based either on our previous in vivo measurements (Arjmand et al., 2009, 2010) when available or on the posture prediction algorithm of the 3DSSPP software. In tasks 1 to 7, intradiscal pressures (IDP) are initially estimated based on computed compression forces at the L4-L5 disc and are subsequently compared to in vivo measurements reported by Wilke et al. (2001) whose male subject had body weight of 72 kg and height of 173.9 cm similar to those considered in our model. The axial compression-IDP relations computed at the L2-L3 for various flexion angles (Shirazi-Adl and Drouin, 1988) are used to estimate L4-L5 disc pressures based on predicted L4-L5 compression forces at different flexion moments.

Each tool needs its own data such as body posture, hand load position and size, and body weight and height to simulate a given task as described here:

The HCBCF equation (Merryweather et al., 2009) estimates the L5-S1 compressive force based on a simplistic single-level (i.e., L5-S1) biomechanical model. This model incorporates only one single equivalent back muscle with a constant sagittal moment arm of 6.9 cm for the male population. The HCBCF equation takes the form of CL5-S1 = 9.81 × {0.0167 (BW) (H) sin θ + 0.145 (L) (HB) + 0.8 (BW/2 + L) + 23} where CL5-S1, BW, H, HB, L, and θ are the estimated L5-S1 compressive load in N, body weight in kg, body height in cm, anterior distance of hands to the L5-S1 in cm, the hand load in kg, and trunk sagittal flexion angle from the vertical in degrees (i.e., taken as 0° for an upright standing posture).

This is a third-order polynomial that predicts the L4-L5 compression force as a function of external moments developed based on an EMG-driven model of the trunk (McGill et al., 1996). The spine model includes 90 muscle fascicles while considering a rigid thorax, rigid pelvis, and five lumbar vertebrae interconnected by rotational springs presenting moment resistance of lumbar segments in three planes (total of 18 rotational degrees of freedom). Muscle forces are estimated based on satisfaction of moment equilibriums at all lumbar joints. The polynomial is subsequently developed based on the regression on the model outputs being the predicted L4-L5 compression force (CL4-L5) for seven slow dynamic tasks performed twice by three male subjects (7 × 2 × 3 tasks in total). Model inputs are the flexion–extension moment (F, negative in flexion) (Nm), lateral bending moment (B, positive to the right) (Nm), and axial twisting moment (T, positive counter-clock wise) (Nm): CL4-L5 = 1067.6 + 1.219 F + 0.083 F2 − 0.0001 F3 + 3.229 B + 0.119 B2 − 0.0001 B3 + 0.862 T + 0.393 T2 − 0.0001 T3.

Body weight and height, load position, and body posture are model inputs while the L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression and shear forces are outputs. Based on the satisfaction of moment equilibrium at a single level, two different models are used to estimate loads at the L5-S1 and L4-L5 levels. The L5-S1 model incorporates only one equivalent back (erector spinae) and one equivalent abdominal (rectus abdominus) muscle while the L4-L5 model incorporates 10 muscles (2 pairs of back and 3 pairs of abdominal muscles) and employs an optimization algorithm (double linear min–max approach, Bean et al., 1988) to resolve the joint redundancy problem. The posture prediction algorithm of this software allows for the estimation of three-dimensional trunk, pelvis, arms, and legs orientations for a given location of hand load.

The Anybody Modelling System v.4.21 (AnyBody Technology A/S, Aalborg, Denmark) has an anatomically detailed biomechanical model of the whole body with numerous muscles. Its trunk spine consists of seven rigid segments (pelvis, five lumbar vertebrae, and thorax) with six ball-and-socket lumbar and thoracolumbar joints having a total of 18 rotational degrees of freedom. Muscles either take straight line of action or nonlinear trajectories passing over several via-points (de Zee et al., 2007). Gravity loading of the rigid thorax is applied at its center of mass but that of the lumbar spine is distributed along its entire length. For a given task, muscle forces and vertebral shear and compressive forces are calculated based on moment equilibrium equations at all levels and using an optimization algorithm (double linear min–max approach) to overcome the kinetics redundancy (Damsgaard et al., 2006). The windows graphical user interface (GUI) of the software is used to prescribe model inputs including load magnitude, load position, and body posture for each task.

Predictive regression models are simple yet accurate user-friendly tools that relate outputs (spine compressive and shear loads) of a complex detailed trunk finite element biomechanical model to its input variables during static lifting activities (Arjmand et al., 2011, 2012). For symmetric lifting activities, sagittal trunk flexion angle (T), lumbopelvic ratio (LP), magnitude of hand load (M) and its anterior (Dx) distance with respect to the L5-S1 disc are the model inputs (Arjmand et al., 2011) while for load holding asymmetric tasks T, M, Dx, and the lateral distance of load to the L5-S1 (Dy) are model inputs (Arjmand et al., 2012). For symmetric lifting activities, the LP ratio is calculated as the lumbar rotation divided by the pelvis rotation where the lumbar rotation is the algebraic difference between measured trunk (T) and pelvis (P) rotations for the lifting activity under consideration. Separate regression models are developed for tasks performed in upright posture where T is zero (Arjmand et al., 2011, 2012). Also, for asymmetric lifting activities separate regression models are developed for one- and two-handed lifting activities (Arjmand et al., 2012). For instance, the L5-S1 compressive force (CL5-S1) for one-handed asymmetric lifting activities in flexed posture is calculated using the following regression model:

                           where T, M, and Dx and Dy are in degree, kg, cm, and cm, respectively, and the spine load (CL5-S1) is calculated in N.

The LSBM tool (Potvin, 1997) estimates the L5-S1 compressive force based on a simplistic single-level (i.e., L5-S1) two-dimensional static linked-segment biomechanical model. The tool requires as inputs coordinates of the L5-S1 joint, subject weight, and hand load magnitude/position to calculate the L5-S1 reaction forces. The extensor moment is produced by a single equivalent back muscle with a constant sagittal moment arm of 6.0 cm to the joint center. To determine the total L5-S1 compression force (FC, L5-S1 in N), the estimated muscle force is directly added to the compression vector of the reaction forces: FC, L5-S1 = ML5-S1/0.06 + sin (TA) × (WtLD + WtCM) where TA is trunk angle between the horizontal line and the line joining L5-S1 and C7-T1 (degree), WtLD is the weight of the hand load (N), WtCM is the weight of the upper body (N) taken equal to 54% of the total body weight for males, and ML5-S1 is the moment of external loads about the L5-S1 center (Nm) equal to WtCM × MACM + WtLD × MALD where MACM and MALD are, respectively, horizontal moment arms (m) of the upper body center of mass and the horizontal moment arm (m) of the hand load to the L5-S1 center. Regression-based models are used to calculate MACM = −0.032 + 0.104 × H −0.004 × V + 0.0000356 × TA + 0.354 × cos (TA) where H is the horizontal distance (m) from the hand load to the ankles and V is the vertical distance (m) from the floor to the hand load. MALD can also be estimated through a regression equation (Potvin, 1997) but in this study it is known for each task (see Section 2.1).

@&#RESULTS@&#

The six tools predicted considerably different compression (Table 1
                      and Figs. 2–3
                     
                     ) and shear (Table 1 and Figs. 4–5
                     
                     ) forces at both L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels for the simulated static lifting activities. Paired correlation analyses indicated that the tools had pattern-wise close predictions in compression loads (with the smallest R
                     2 value of 0.87 and most of R
                     2 values above 0.95) (Table 2
                     ). Estimates of the coefficients of variation (CV, i.e., standard deviation divided by mean) for the predicted spine loads in different tasks indicated that the tool outputs had very different magnitudes particularly in shear loads (Fig. 6
                     ).

The three tools that provided estimates for the spine loads at both L4-L5 and L5-S1 discs (i.e., 3DSSPP, AnyBody, and regression models) predicted greater shear at the L5-S1 level and also generally greater compression at this level (Table 1 and Figs. 2–5) indicating the L5-S1 disc as the critical level. Regression models generally estimated higher L5-S1 shear forces compared to other tools (Table 1 and Fig. 4). The simple polynomial tool predicted the greatest L4-L5 compression force in the lightest (i.e., 1064 N in task 1) and most demanding (6651 N in task 22) tasks (Table 1). The regression models estimated the smallest L5-S1 compression forces in tasks 9–12. The regression models and the AnyBody Modelling System predicted L4-L5 IDP values that, compared to other tools, were overall in closer agreement with in vivo data for tasks 1–7 (Fig. 7
                     ) (root-mean-square error of 0.12, 0.35, 0.12, and 0.23 MPa for regression models, 3DSSPP, AnyBody, and simple polynomial, respectively).

Among the six tools, only the simple polynomial and 3DSSPP model yielded distinct results (at the L4-L5 disc) when the load was carried on the left side versus the right side (task 7 versus 8 and task 19 versus 20) (e.g., maximal difference of ∼21% for simple polynomial and of ∼10% for 3DSSPP between tasks 7 and 8 for the L4-L5 compression load) (Table 1). Predictions of the regression models, the simple polynomial, and the HCBCF equation were not sensitive to variations in hand load height (while at constant horizontal distance from the body) during symmetric lifting tasks in upright posture (tasks 9–12 and 16–18) (e.g., maximal difference of ∼26% for AnyBody between tasks 10 and 12 for the L4-L5 compression load). Likewise, the 3DSSPP models' predictions were identical for tasks 10–12 (i.e., no sensitivity to variations in hand load height). Unlike other tools, the LSBM and HCBCF models predicted identical and the 3DSSPP predicted very similar L5-S1 compression loads when the load of 19.8 kg in tasks 7 and 8 (held on one side in one hand) was split symmetrically between both hands (9.9 kg in each hand) as in task 9 (Table 1).

The AnyBody Modelling System failed to converge for some lifting activities (tasks 6, 11, and 22) (Table 1). The tools responded very differently to variations in the magnitude of the hand load in task 2 (Table 3
                     ). Unlike other tools, the simple polynomial predicted only 16% increase in the L4-L5 compression as hand load increased from 0 kg to 19.8 kg (∼210% for 3DSSPP, 186% for regression models, and 152% for AnyBody). The HCBCF equation, the LSBM model, and the L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP (which are all single equivalent muscle models) predicted linear variations in spine loads as the weight in hands altered (e.g., ∼30 N increase in the L5-S1 shear force for each 4.95 kg increase in the hand load in the L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP) (Table 3). The regression models predicted smaller variations in compressive loads and larger variations in shear loads as hand load increased. 3DSSPP and AnyBody, that use the double linear min–max optimization approach, predicted irregular variations in spinal loads as the magnitude of hand load changed at a fixed posture (Table 3).

In terms of ease-of-use to simulate a given task, the regression models, the LSBM model, and the HCBCF equation were more user-friendly than the other tools. The simple polynomial tool needed as input the moment of body weight whose calculation required deformed shape and anthropometric data. The AnyBody Modelling System needed development of computer code for simulation of the tasks and, along with the 3DSSPP model, required a sound knowledge of the software. Some features of various tools as well as their recommended application domains are summarized in Table 4
                      and discussed in details below.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The predictions by six lifting tools of spinal loads at the two lowermost lumbar levels were compared under a wide range of static lifting activities. Results indicated significant differences between the estimated magnitudes of shear and compression loads (Table 1) despite relatively similar patterns for compression loads (Table 2). The estimated risk of injury could hence vary depending on the tool used. For instance, while the regression models and HCBCF equation suggested an elevated risk of injury in task 13, where the predicted L5-S1 compressive loads (3645 N and 3472 N, respectively) exceeded the NIOSH recommended limit of 3400 N, the AnyBody Modelling System, 3DSSPP, and LSBM tools predicted smaller values below 3400 N (Table 1). Similarly, for task 21 the regression models estimated a shear force of 1424 N that is beyond the recommended safe limit of 1000 N (Gallagher and Marras, 2012; McGill, 1997; McGill et al., 1998) while the AnyBody Modelling System and 3DSSPP tools predicted values smaller than 1000 N (values beyond the recommended limits are in bold in Table 1). A comprehensive evaluation of methods used and assumptions made in each lifting tool is provided below with attention on shortcomings and recommended application domains of each tool (Table 4). This is essential to develop confidence in estimations and to help provide much-needed guidance to practitioners in the field of occupational health and ergonomics.

These are simple two-dimensional single-joint (L5-S1) models of the spine with only one equivalent back muscle (Merryweather et al., 2009; Potvin, 1997; University of Michigan Center for Ergonomics, 2014). As such, they neglect the consideration of equilibrium at other levels, the distinct role and anatomy of various extensor (lumbar and thoracic) muscles, abdominal muscles (and co-activation), and passive ligamentous properties. The HCBCF and LSBM do not provide any estimates of shear forces and L4-L5 compressive loads. Furthermore, these tools (i.e., HCBCF, LSBM, and L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP) are not appropriate for evaluation of asymmetric lifting tasks where the load is held out of the sagittal plane. For instance, while the regression models and the Anybody Modelling System that are both based on anatomically detailed biomechanical models predict L5-S1 compression forces of respectively 1588 N and 1832 N for an asymmetric one-handed lifting (task 7), the L5-S1 3DSSPP, HCBCF, and LSBM models predict only 444 N, 621 N, and 497 N respectively (Table 1 and Fig. 2); indicating the inaccuracy of these tools in the evaluation of asymmetric tasks. In this task, the L4-L5 model of 3DSSPP predicts 2217 N compression load. The 3DSSPP software itself has indicated that only sagittally symmetric lifting tasks should be analysed with their L5-S1 model. Although the LSBM tool is developed assuming the symmetry of load handling (Potvin, 1997), but it has been suggested (van Dieen et al., 2010) that ignoring asymmetry in this tool does not necessarily result in the underestimation of the L5-S1 compressive load as compared with the anatomically detailed biomechanical models. Nevertheless we call for caution when single muscle models are used to simulate asymmetric activities as they neglect the crucial role of oblique abdominal muscles in these activities.

In disagreement with a recent in vivo-modelling study (McGill et al., 2013) that reports considerably smaller spinal loads when a load held on one side is split symmetrically between both hands, these tools do not predict smaller spinal forces when the load of 19.8 kg in tasks 7 and 8 (held on one side) is split symmetrically between both hands (9.9 kg on each side) as in task 9 (Table 1). Moreover, these tools along with the regression models (see Section 4.5) and simple polynomial (see Section 4.2) fail to properly predict larger spinal compression as load height increases at a constant horizontal moment arm (tasks 9–12). This is in disagreement with in vivo studies indicating increasing back and abdominal muscle activities (in response to stability demands) as load height increases at a constant level arm (Arjmand et al., 2009; Granata and Orishimo, 2001). The 3DSSPP model was however able to predict this trend for tasks 16–18. Apart from these shortcomings, the predictions of HCBCF, LSBM, and the L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP for the L5-S1 compression force in symmetric tasks fall generally, despite theirs simplicity, within the range of those of the other two lifting tools (AnyBody, and regression models) that are based on more complex models (Fig. 2 and Tables 1 and 3). Therefore, in view of their ease of use, these tools may be cautiously applied to evaluate the L5-S1 compression force considering their shortcomings and preferred application domains discussed above and summarized in Table 4.

This tool does not provide any estimates for compressive load at the critical L5-S1 joint and similar to the HCBCF equation does not predict shear loads either. This is the only tool whose predictions are based on an EMG-driven model that takes antagonistic co-activities into account when estimating L4-L5 compression forces (McGill et al., 1996). It is, hence, exposed to the assumptions and shortcomings of EMG-driven models with regard to EMG measurements of deep or larger muscles, measurement of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for normalization, and determination of the gain to satisfy equilibrium in different planes (see Arjmand et al., 2009, 2010). The polynomial equation is developed based on a fitting procedure on the model's inputs-outputs and as a result introduces errors. Since regression-fitted equations produce maximal errors at the border regions of input variables (i.e., in very light and very demanding tasks) (Arjmand et al., 2011), the L4-L5 compression force for task 1 (least demanding task) and task 22 (most demanding lifting task with both load and posture asymmetry) are least reliable (Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 7). Also, the sensitivity of the tool to variations in the hand load at the fixed posture of task 2 was unrealistically small (only 171 N increase in the L4-L5 compression as hand load increased by ∼195 N from 0 to 19.8 kg) (Table 3). Predictions were also in disagreement with in vivo IDP data when comparing relative changes between tasks 1 and 2 (Fig. 7) as well as with findings of the other tools when hand-held load was altered (Table 3). Apart from these tasks, its predictions for the L4-L5 compression force fell generally within the range of those of the other three lifting tools (3DSSPP, AnyBody, and regression models) that are based on optimization (Fig. 3). Although the tool is based on a simple polynomial equation, calculation of its input moments is time consuming particularly the portion due to the body weight. To evaluate the moment of body weight one requires the position of the center of mass of the upper body with respect to the L4-L5 disc center through either in vivo measurements or anthropometric data.

The simple polynomial and, to a lesser extent, the 3DSSPP software are the only tools that predict different spinal loads in tasks 7 and 8 as well as 19 and 20 in which a load is held either on the left or on the right (Table 1). This is because the simple polynomial is based on a biomechanical model that predicts muscle forces using an EMG-driven approach. As for the 3DSSPP model which is based on an optimization-driven algorithm the only reason for estimating different spinal loads in these tasks could be due to different muscle anatomies on the left and right sides. Other tools (regression models, AnyBody, and HCBCF) use symmetric architecture for trunk muscles thus predicting identical spinal forces in these tasks (Table 1). Similar to the single muscle models (HCBCF, LSBM, and L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP) and in disagreement with in vivo studies (Arjmand et al., 2009; Granata and Orishimo, 2001) the simple polynomial tool does not predict larger spinal compression as the load height increases at a constant horizontal moment arm (tasks 9–12 and 16–18). Despite these shortcomings, this tool can be used to simulate symmetric and asymmetric lifting tasks although it provides no estimates of the risk of injury at the critical L5-S1 level (Table 4).

Unlike its L5-S1 model, the L4-L5 single-level model of 3DSSPP incorporates 10 trunk muscles (including oblique ones) and its predictions for compressive loads are comparable with those of AnyBody and the regression models (Fig. 3). The L4-L5 model uses an optimization-driven approach to predict muscle forces and thus it is prone to all the shortcomings of such algorithms including neglecting forces in antagonistic muscles. Unlike other tools as well as in disagreement with in vivo IDP values, 3DSSPP predicts a reduction in the L4-L5 compression forces as trunk bends forward from moderate (i.e., 50° in tasks 4) to peak (i.e., 110° in task 6) flexion (Table 1 and Fig. 7). As the trunk flexes forward, the moment of body weight and as a result back muscle forces (sum of passive and active components) and spine compressive load increase. This shortcoming equally exists in the L5-S1 model of 3DSSPP model (a reduction in the L5-S1 compression forces from tasks 4 to 6 (Table 1)). It is hence prudent not to use this software at and around peak flexion angles (Table 4). Also, probably due to the optimization algorithm used (double linear min–max approach), the sensitivity of the L4-L5 compression model of this tool to load increment from 0 to 4.95 kg in task 2 is very small (e.g., only 117 N increase compared to its increases of 212–222 N for additional increments) (Table 3). Moreover, the predicted L4-L5 shear loads in asymmetric lifting tasks 19 and 20 (40 and 39 N, respectively) are considerably smaller than those predicted by AnyBody and regression models and even smaller than its own prediction of 138 N in task 1 in relaxed upright standing posture without a hand load (Table 1).

Compared to other tools this modelling software uses the most detailed representation of muscles. The model by its default option (used in the current study) does not incorporate passive properties of intervertebral discs, facet joints and posterior ligaments and also neglects all translational degrees of freedom (ball and socket joints). One can use different optimization cost functions in the software (e.g., sum of cubed muscle stresses similar to the regression models) but here in this study the default one (double linear approach similar to the 3DSSPP) was used. Likewise, one can estimate spine loads at the mid-disc point (similar to the regression models) but the default responses (at the lower endplate of the discs) were considered. Predictions of this software for the L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression forces are similar to those of the regression models for most of the simulated tasks in this study (Table 1 and Figs. 2–3) and also along with the regression models predict L4-L5 intradiscal pressure that agree well with in vivo data (Fig. 7). The estimated L4-L5 and L5-S1 shear forces are for some tasks close to and for others different from those of 3DSSPP and regression models. Similar to the L4-L5 model of 3DSSPP, the sensitivity of this tool in task 2 to the first load increment from 0 to 4.95 kg is much smaller than that in the following increments (e.g., respectively 63 and 67 N increases in the L4-L5 and L5-S1 compression forces compared to 201–236 N for subsequent increments) (Table 3). In agreement with the experimental in vivo studies (Arjmand et al., 2009; Granata and Orishimo, 2001), this software is the only tool that predicts larger spinal loads as load height increases (tasks 9–12 and 16–18) which could be due to changes in moments due to the movement of the arms and/or shoulder muscle activities (e.g., latissimus dorsi). The software can therefore be used to simulate a wide range of both symmetric and asymmetric lifting activities while considering its few shortcomings discussed above and summarized in Table 4. As a major shortcoming, compared to other tools, however, this software is rather difficult to be used by practitioners due to the required programming procedure.

These equations were developed based on the detailed nonlinear finite element model of the thoracolumbar spine in which 76 muscle fascicles along with proper wrapping and associated contact forces of global back muscles around bony structures are considered. This tool incorporates nonlinear passive properties of the ligamentous spine (discs, ligaments, and vertebrae) at different levels and planes, detailed gravity loading distributed along the entire length of the thoracolumbar spine, and all rotational and translational degrees of freedom at all T12-S1 levels (Arjmand and Shirazi-Adl, 2006; Arjmand et al., 2006). The biomechanical fidelity of the model, however, has made it too complex and time-consuming for routine use in practical applications and thus simple full quadratic regression models with high quality of fit in terms of both root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and R
                        2 values were developed to relate the model's outputs for spinal loads to its inputs (Arjmand et al., 2011, 2012). These equations are based on lifting activities performed either symmetrically with the load held by both hands (all symmetric tasks excluding tasks 9–12) or one-handed and two-handed asymmetric lifts with symmetric postures (all asymmetric tasks but task 22). In disagreement with the experimental in vivo studies (Arjmand et al., 2009; Granata and Orishimo, 2001), as the height of loads held in hands changes while keeping the posture and load lever arm constant (tasks 9–12 and 16–18) the regression equations predict identical spinal loads. Simulations of tasks involving loads held symmetrically on both sides (tasks 9–12) should be avoided (Table 4) as the predictions of regression equations for these tasks are clearly inaccurate even compared to those in the relaxed upright posture with no load in hands (task 1). This is because, for symmetric lifting in upright postures, the regression equations are originally developed based on the assumption of hand loads being at least 20 cm in front of the shoulder joints. Simulation of two-handed lifting activities with the center of mass of the load very close to the body (such as loads held on sides) should therefore be avoided (Table 4). Despite these shortcomings, the regression models can be used to simulate a wide range of lifting activities with both symmetric and asymmetric hand held loads.

@&#LIMITATIONS@&#

This study was limited to static activities with and without weights in hands while dynamic activities and those with pulling and pushing (i.e., oblique external loads) were excluded. As simulations were performed with a constant body weight and height considered in the tools, the effect of such personal factors on differences between the tools for the predicted spinal loads was not thus investigated. Only the two lowermost lumbar joints (L4-L5 and L5-S1) which are recognized clinically as the most critical levels (Arjmand et al., 2006) were considered while the AnyBody Modelling System could also predict loads at the remaining lumbar spinal levels as well.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In summary, critical assessment of the underlying assumptions of these six lifting analysis tools was carried out with the expectation to identify which tools are more appropriate for the evaluation of a given activity. Results indicated significant differences between the tools for the predicted spinal loads especially shear forces. Due to existing differences between predicted spinal loads, the estimated risk of injury could also vary depending on the tool used. In terms of accuracy of the tools in light of comparison of their predictions for compression forces with available in vivo intradiscal pressure measurements, the regression models and the AnyBody Modelling System predicted L4-L5 IDP values that, compared to other tools, were in closer agreement with in vivo data for tasks 1 to 7 (Fig. 7). In terms of ease-of-use to simulate a given task, the regression models, the LSBM, and HCBCF equation were more user-friendly compared to other tools. As both ease-of-use and accuracy of the tools should be considered for practical applications we therefore suggest the regression models as the choice in this regard. Practitioners are, however, encouraged to consult Table 4 for essential features as well as recommended application domains of each tool before use in practical applications.
