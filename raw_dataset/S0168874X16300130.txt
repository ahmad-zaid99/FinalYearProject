                  Two models for completing structural analyses of cured fabric-reinforced composites that link back to a forming simulation are investigated. The objective of each model is to seamlessly use the predicted geometries of the textile plies to generate a finite element model of the cured structure. The first is a beam-shell model, where beam elements represent the fibers and shell elements represent the matrix. The beams are imported directly from the forming model to capture the deformed fabric geometry. The second approach is a double-orthotropic shell model where two shells, each representing a set of fibers, i.e. warp or weft, are superimposed. The material orientation in each shell is aligned with the respective fiber directions. To investigate the capabilities of the models for unidirectional-fiber reinforced composite plates with multiple fiber orientations and loading configurations, the two models are compared to classical laminate theory (CLT). To explore the models׳ ability to represent a plain-weave textile reinforced composite plate with various shear angles in the fabric reinforcements, the two proposed models are compared to experimental data. The double orthotropic shell model is found to be a better option for linking the mechanical behavior of the formed composite back to the simulation of the manufacturing process than the beam-shell model.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Composite materials are attractive for their high specific strength and high specific stiffness properties as compared to traditional metals [1–3]. While composites have the potential to create fuel-efficient vehicles, automotive companies are reluctant to replace metals with composites due to the higher costs and longer production cycle times [4] and the lack of reliable models for predicting the response of these materials during a crash situation. Researchers are currently investigating ways to reduce cycle times by automating the forming process through manufacturing techniques such as thermoforming of textile-reinforced composites [5–8], thereby making the composite manufacturing process to be competitive with metal forming cycle times. Complementary research is being pursued to develop simulation models of these automated composite manufacturing processes [8–18]. These models can be used to guide the design of the manufacturing process (e.g. selection of textiles, size and shape of the textile blanks, induced in-plane tension to reduce wrinkling) and can provide a direct link to build a high-fidelity model of the cured composite structure which can subsequently be used for structural analyses (e.g. stiffness, vibration and crash). Before such models can be widely accepted for use by industry, they must first be shown to provide credible predictions for structural performance.

Finite element modeling provides one option for a virtual design tool that can link the output of a simulation of the manufacturing process to a structural model of the composite component. Such a tool provides composite designers with the ability to model the manufacturing process, to identify if and where defects may manifest and to assess whether they will have a significant detrimental effect on the structural integrity of the part. By identifying unfavorable features of substantial influence, efforts can be focused on removing critical defects from the part instead of the overwhelming task of attempting to create a completely defect-free structure [19].

This paper will review existing design tools that can potentially link the manufacturing process to the resulting stiffness and quality of the composite part. In addition, two new modeling techniques will be introduced: the beam-shell model and the double orthotropic-shell model. Each of these models will address shortcomings that exist in current technologies by including the ability to represent the reinforcement fabric that has sheared during manufacturing. The feasibility of each model will be examined in a numerical study. Both structural modeling approaches will be compared to classical laminate theory (CLT) for a hypothetical unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite. The models will be assessed for a range of typical fiber orientations. Currently, there is no universally-accepted modeling technique for woven fabric-reinforced composites. Therefore, both modeling schemes will be compared to experimental data for a woven-fabric reinforced composite. The pros and cons of each model are reported.

The existing modeling techniques for fiber-reinforced composites will be reviewed. Methods for modeling unidirectional fiber reinforced composites are well established but generally do not account for deformations of the fibers during manufacturing. Woven-fabric reinforced composites are not as easily modeled as non-crimp fabric reinforced composites. Current techniques are presented and the existing shortcomings are discussed.

The popular method for the modeling of unidirectional fiber-reinforced composite materials is Classical Lamination Theory (CLT), which is the universally accepted analytical approach [2]. Commercially available finite element packages, such as Abaqus, ANSYS, and LS-DYNA, have composite layup features with material properties formulated using CLT. This feature allows the user to define multiple layers with multiple materials, orientations, and layer thicknesses [20,21]. Programs such as CATIA and FiberSIM can interface with these FEA platforms to offer designers the ability to include fabric reorientation due to manufacturing processes in their analyses. These interfacing programs use a fishnet algorithm to predict how the fabric will deform to conform to the shape of the mold. Once the deformation of the fabric has been predicted by the interface, the fiber orientations are fed into the composite layup feature of an associated finite element package. While such software offer a quick solution for capturing variations in effective fiber orientations within each ply as it conforms to the tool geometry, the fishnet algorithm is limited in its ability to simulate the forming process. For example, effects due to boundary conditions are not considered by the fishnet algorithm. Therefore, two simulations performed on the same geometry with different binder pressures would yield the same results. Additionally, the fishnet algorithm does not consider the mechanical behavior of the fabric. Consequently, the simulations are unable to capture manufacturing defects such as in-plane and out-of-plane buckling that can be incurred during the forming process [11]. Therefore, these models would not be able to study the relationship between the processing parameters and the formation of manufacturing defects. Without knowing if and where defects occurred, their subsequent influence on structural performance could not be explored. Thus, users should limit the use of fishnet-based programs to geometries with gentle smooth surfaces. For more complex geometries, the fabric deformation needs to contain not only the kinematics (as are captured by fishnet algorithms) but also consider the mechanical behavior of the specific fabrics.

The modeling of woven fabrics does not lend itself directly to a CLT analysis because a single ply of woven fabric contains two sets of fiber orientations (warp and weft) within the same plane. While CLT is commonly used to analyze laminates with multiple fiber orientations, the plies within the laminate are considered to be discrete unidirectional fiber layers. Analytical models exist that attempt to capture the woven mechanical behavior using CLT derivations such as the “mosaic” model, the fiber undulation model, and the bridging model [22,23]. Other models use a micromechanical approach to homogenize the fabric repeating unit cell and derive orthotropic properties of the composite [16,24]. However, once the fabric has sheared, it is no longer an orthotropic material as the warp and the weft tows reorient from their initial mutually perpendicular configurations as is shown in 
                        Fig. 1. This shearing poses an additional challenge to modeling the behavior of a woven-fabric reinforced composite.

While modeling strategies exist to represent woven-fabric reinforced composites, these models always assume that the tows are mutually perpendicular. However, for a woven fabric to conform to a compound-curvature surface, the tows must become non-orthogonal. Thus, such an orthogonality assumption compromises the solution for any composite with a compound-curvature surface. The two techniques examined in this paper offer the ability to model a composite in which the fiber tows have sheared and are no longer mutually perpendicular.

Brief descriptions of the methodologies used for the beam-shell model and the double orthotropic-shell model are presented in the following sections.

The beam-shell model is a discrete mesoscopic finite element model. The model employs a mixed-mesh unit cell approach to represent a woven-textile, as shown in 
                        Fig. 2. The unit cell of the fabric is represented by a two-dimensional shell element (S4) surrounded by four one-dimensional beam elements (B31). The beam elements represent the tensile and flexural behaviors of fiber tows, while shell elements capture the shear behavior of the fabric.

This methodology has been implemented in Abaqus/Explicit [8,12,15,25] and successfully used to model the forming of composite structures. The discrete modeling of the fibers by the beam elements provides for the automatic tracking of the change in the orientations of the primary load paths within the composite system during the manufacturing process where the fabric shears to accommodate compound-curvature features in the tooling.

Mitchell et al. proposed a method to extend the use of the beam-shell model to the structural behavior of the final part in Abaqus/Standard [26]. This model uses the deformed mesh resulting from the forming simulation to represent the cured composite. It has the ability to link the output from the simulation of the forming process to the structural properties and formed geometry (including any defects such as wrinkling and folds in the fabric) of the final part. The beam elements continue to represent the fiber tows while the shell elements represent the matrix material in the cured part. A method for discretizing the stiffness contribution of individual constituents was developed previously [26]. For a flat composite plate reinforced by a 0/90 textile, the model demonstrated the ability to correlate well with experimental data for the quasi-static flexural behavior and the modal response of the tested plates.

The double orthotropic-shell (DOS) methodology utilizes the standard orthotropic shells within Abaqus/Standard. By discretizing the woven fabric into the separate warp and weft contributions, the fabric can be described as two unidirectional plies occupying the same physical space without the limitation of mutually perpendicular warp and weft tows. Once this discretization has been made, a traditional CLT approach can be used to describe each of the unidirectional contributions to the overall behavior. This approach is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 3 for the case of the tows being perpendicular.

The behavior of the composite attributed to the fibers in the warp direction is represented by one set of shell elements while the behavior of the composite attributed to the fibers in the weft direction is represented by a coincident set of shell elements. By treating each set of fibers as a unidirectional lamina, in-plane shear can be represented as discrete fiber rotations.

The material properties implemented in the double orthotropic-shell model are the orthotropic material properties for each effective unidirectional lamina. Both material sets will occupy the entire volume defined by the model dimensions. In reality, each element only contributes to a portion of the total volume, similar to the representation of a composite by the mosaic model. This concept is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 4(a) and (b). The mosaic (M) model represents the warp and weft as alternating discrete entities as seen in Fig. 4(c), while the double orthotropic-shell model represents two elements with discrete material properties in the same volume.

Both models must represent the same material properties for an orthotropic material. Considering the entries in the ABD matrix of CLT, the mosaic (M) and double-orthotropic shell (DOS) approaches require:

Eq. (3.2) indicates that the material must be symmetric, i.e. B
                        
                           ij
                        =0. While the mosaic model depicted in Fig. 4(a) does not represent a symmetric layup, the mosaic model is comprised of small units of alternating cells shown in Fig. 4(c) averaging to a symmetric lamina. Similarly, a plain-weave fabric is also considered a symmetric about the centerline.

Eqs. (3.1) and (3.3) can be simplified:

                        indicating that the sum of the properties implemented into the double orthotropic-shell model must be half of the sum of the properties represented in the mosaic model. Each reduced stiffness constant Q
                        
                           ij
                         is directly proportional to either the longitudinal modulus, E
                        1, the transverse modulus, E
                        2, or the shear modulus, G. Therefore, by dividing these properties in half when implementing them into the double orthotropic-shell model, the material will be represented properly.

Numerical analyses were performed to explore how well each of the two proposed models could accurately capture the mechanical behavior of a cured fiber-reinforced composite material. The first analysis used each model to represent a unidirectional-fiber reinforced composite. The results were compared to the globally accepted CLT solution, and both models were expected to correlate well. For the models to offer a global solution over all configurations, they must demonstrate the ability to capture the same behavior as predicted by CLT analyses. In the second analysis, the models were utilized to represent a woven-fabric reinforced composite. Because there is no universally accepted solution for woven-fabric reinforced composites, the trends demonstrated by these models were compared to published experimental data [27].

A qualitative analysis was performed using the three modeling techniques for a hypothetical 35% fiber-volume fraction unidirectional fiberglass-reinforced polypropylene composite plate. The material properties are given in 
                        Table 1. Each model was configured to represent a unidirectional-fiber reinforced material.

For the beam-shell model, the weft set of beam elements was deleted from the mesh to provide a model of a unidirectional-fiber reinforced composite. Similarly, the weft set of shell elements was deleted from the double orthotropic-shell mesh, resulting in a standard orthotropic shell model defined by the composite layup feature within Abaqus/Standard.

The properties implemented into the beam-shell model were determined by the material definition of the discrete constituents. Because the models for this comparison were only being loaded in-plane, the shape of the beam cross-sections was not a critical factor as long as the area of the fiber tow was properly represented. Therefore, the beam elements utilized a rectangular profile (3.5mm×0.10mm) with the same height as the shell elements (0.10mm). The shell elements occupied the entire volume of the composite plate, but the matrix only occupies 65% of the material volume in the physical composite plate. To compensate for this effective matrix volume, the modulus of the polypropylene matrix for use in the model was scaled to 65% of its total value. The orthotropic material properties were calculated using the rule of mixtures [2] and were implemented into the CLT analysis and the orthotropic shell model.

The second qualitative study was performed to examine how well each of the models represented the mechanical behavior of a woven-fabric reinforced composite. The woven-fabric models were built to replicate the experimental dimensions of Twintex® plates manufactured with prescribed in-plane shear angles. A schematic of the yarn orientations is given in 
                        Fig. 5. The models included the re-orientated warp yarns and the observed change in thickness as a function of in-plane shear angle, as reported in 
                        Table 2.

The material properties were taken from the Twintex® manufacturer׳s specifications [28]. The fabric is comprised of 35% E-glass and 65% polypropylene by volume. The tensile modulus along the fiber direction was reported as 26.5MPa. A simple rule-of-mixtures calculation based on an assumed glass modulus of 70GPa implies that the polypropylene should have a modulus of 3GPa. A summary of the calculated material properties is given in 
                        Table 3.

The material properties implemented into the double orthotropic-shell model for E
                        1, E
                        2, and G
                        12 were half of the values given in Table 3 as indicated by Eqs. (4.1) and (4.2). Additionally, a parametric study was performed on the material inputs E
                        2 and G
                        12 as the rule of mixtures generally under-predicts these properties due to the iso-stress assumption inherent to the equations [2,29–32]. The modified rule of mixtures, introduced by Halpin [29], was considered with various partitioning factors (η). This parametric study, varying η, was performed to gain insight to the effect of the material properties have on the behavior of the model.

The beam-shell model and the orthotropic shell model were compared to an analytical CLT solution. Each model examined fiber orientations ranging from 0° to 90° in 10° increments (
                        Fig. 6). For example, a fiber orientation of 0° indicates that the fibers are parallel with the x-axis while a fiber orientation of 90° indicates that the fibers are parallel with the y-axis.

Each model was loaded in three test configurations: a 100-MPa stress in the x-direction, a 100-MPa stress in the y-direction, and a 100-MPa in-plane shear stress. For each configuration, the strain in the x-direction, strain in the y-direction, and in-plane shear strain were examined and compared among the modeling approaches. The results of these investigations are summarized in 
                        Fig. 7.

As expected, the CLT solution and the orthotropic-shell model generate the same results. However, the beam-shell model results deviate from the CLT solution when the fibers are not aligned with the loading direction.

The poor correlation between CLT and beam-shell model predictions can be explained by the assumed simplification representing the fiber tows with beam elements. Beam element simplifications ignore the lateral-stiffness and shear-stiffness contributions to the overall stiffness of the finite element model. When these elements are used the fiber tows in the forming simulations, the lateral-stiffness and shear-stiffness contributions of the fiber tows are negligible due to the lack of matrix material. The beam simplification is valid as shear loads and transverse loads cannot be transferred into the fibers. Any contribution the fiber tow makes to the overall shear stiffness of the fabric is captured by the shell element. However, after the fabric has been infused with the matrix material, the matrix transfers these types of loads to the fibers. Therefore, the fibers can no longer be represented by beam elements.

To compensate for the limitations resulting from the beam element simplifications, a series of analyses were completed where the modulus of the resin was scaled for each loading condition. The scale factor was calculated by dividing the analytical strain (calculated by CLT) by the numerical strain (predicted by the beam-shell model) in the direction of the load. For example, the scaling factor for stress in the x-direction, σx
                        , is:

The results for these scaled models are also given in Fig. 7 as the “Modified Beam-Shell” model data.

The scale factors used to modify the modulus of the resin are shown in 
                        Fig. 8. The shortcomings of the beam elements are most obvious when the composite is loaded in shear. The scaling factors required are almost double the required scaling factors for a uniaxial load.

Additionally, this graph indicates that the same model must be modified using different scaling factors for different loading conditions. For example, a plate with a 30° fiber orientation requires a scaling factor of 2.285 when loaded in the x-direction, a scaling factor of 2.231 when loaded in the y-direction, and a scaling factor of 4.232 when subjected to in-plane shear. This discrepancy indicates that the beam-shell model could not offer an accurate solution if the composite experienced complex loading.

It can be concluded that the beam-shell model offers a reasonable solution for a simple loading case. However, it cannot currently be considered a global solution to model the behavior of composite materials. Other element types offer more robust beam formulations. For example, the B31H elements within Abaqus provide transverse shear stiffness. These elements were explored; however they did not add much additional benefit over the B31 elements for the loading cases examined. Further work to develop a beam element that can provide an in-plane shear stiffness (G
                        12) and a lateral stiffness (E
                        2) must be available before the beam-shell model can be used for structural analyses fiber-reinforced composite.

Beam-shell models and double orthotropic-shell models were created to represent each of the plates reported in Table 4.2. Each plate was tested using a three-point-bending configuration as shown in 
                        Fig. 9 (a). The results of the tests are given by Mitchell et al. [27]. A bending test was simulated for each model as given in Fig. 9 (b).

The slope of the load-displacement curve was output for each model. The trends observed experimentally were compared to the trends seen in the models. One analysis was performed to simulate bending in the x-direction and a subsequent analysis was conducted to simulate bending in the y-direction. The slope of the load-displacement curves for each beam-shell model and each double orthotropic-shell model were calculated and compared to the experimental data as presented in 
                        Fig. 10.

Both models predict higher slopes than the experimental results. This overprediction can be attributed to the discrepancies between the calculated material properties implemented into the model as compared to the physical material properties of the plate. The material properties calculated from the rule of mixtures assume the fibers are aligned within the plane of the material. The plates are made of a woven material which has inherent fiber undulations as shown in 
                        Fig. 11(a). This fabric architecture results in a reduced in-plane modulus as compared to its biaxial counterpart shown in Fig. 11(b) [22,33–35].

Naik and Shembekar [35] demonstrated that including the effects of fiber undulation in predicting the effective modulus of a woven-fabric reinforced composite resulted in a reduced modulus as compared to a simple rule-of-mixtures calculation. The results indicated that the rule-of-mixtures calculation overpredict the global modulus along the fiber direction by a factor of 1.8–2.2 depending on the ratio of the fiber undulation to the yarn width. Further, the global modulus of the composite is higher than the modulus implemented in the double orthotropic-shell model because the global modulus represents both the warp and the weft tows.

The average overprediction of the beam-shell models and double orthotropic-shell models as compared to the experimental data that is shown in Fig. 10 is a factor of 2.3. While this factor is slightly higher than the factors demonstrated by Naik and Shembekar, it is within a reasonable range due to the differences between the moduli implemented in the double orthotropic-shell model and the global moduli of the composite. Additionally, voids were present in the experimental samples but these voids were not explicitly considered in the finite element models.

To assist in the understanding the source of the discrepancies between the model and experimental results as were being seen in the post-analysis presented in Fig. 10, the slopes of the load-displacement curves were normalized by those of the respective unsheared test or model, respectively. For example, the slope of the experimental load–displacement curve for bending in the x-direction for a plate with a 25° shear angle was divided by the slope of the experimental load-displacement curve for bending in the x-direction for a plate with a 0° shear angle. The result was the normalized slope of the load–displacement curve for bending in the x-direction for a plate with a 25° shear angle. The results are presented in 
                        Fig. 12.

Again, the lack of shear stiffness and lateral stiffness in the beam elements was found to be detrimental to the quality of the solution from the beam-shell model. While the trends demonstrated for small fiber rotations, such as 10°, were predicted reasonably well, the beam-shell model was unable to follow the overall trends as seen experimentally over the full range of angles. The double orthotropic-shell model with a partitioning factor η=1 demonstrated most of the trends that were seen in the experimental results and all normalized slopes fall within the experimental standard deviation with the exception of the 30° plate being bent in the Y-direction.

The results of the parametric study on the partition factor, η, used to calculate the transverse modulus, E
                        2, and the in-plane shear modulus, G
                        12, are shown in 
                        Fig. 13. It can be seen that the transverse modulus and the shear modulus have very little influence on the trends demonstrated by the double orthotropic-shell model for small shear angles. However, the effect of these properties becomes slightly more pronounced as the shear angle increases. In particular, the normalized slope is significantly affected by the partition factor for bending in the y-direction, i.e. the direction from which the fibers are being rotated away, for a plate with a 30° shear angle in the fabric reinforcement. These results indicate that thorough understandings of the transverse modulus and the in-plane shear modulus are required to model the behavior of woven-fabric reinforced composites with a high level of confidence, especially when the fiber tows are no longer mutually perpendicular.

While the double orthotropic-shell model shows promise, the method to experimentally determine the material properties of the warp shells and the weft shells must be further developed. Once the ability to discretize the contribution of the warp and the weft yarns is developed, the double orthotropic-shell model has the potential to be a powerful design tool. The model can be coupled with the existing beam-shell model that predicts the deformation of fabric during the thermoforming process. The results of the forming model can be used to determine the orientation of the warp and weft tows. Once the orientations have been determined, the double orthotropic-shell model can be used to perform an analysis on the deformed geometry. It has the ability to explore how manufacturing defects affect the mechanical behavior of the part.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Two methodologies to model the behavior of woven-fabric reinforced composites were presented. The goal of both models was to create a design tool that could be used to link the deformation of the fabric resulting from the manufacturing process (i.e. fiber reorientations and manufacturing defects) to the structural behavior of the cured part.

The beam-shell model is an extension of an existing forming methodology. A discrete mesh was used to represent the individual constituents of the composite: beam elements represented the fiber tows while shell elements represented the matrix. This methodology has been shown previously to work well to predict the mechanical behavior of a fabric during a forming process. However, for the cured composite modeling approaches considered in the current research, the model did not follow the expected trends for change in stiffness as the fibers were rotated away from the loading direction. This discrepancy was explained by the beam theory simplifications inherent in formulation of the beam element. For example, beam elements do not have either lateral stiffness or shear stiffness. However, the fiber reinforcements within the composite do contribute to the overall lateral stiffness and shear stiffness of the composite; thus, the lack of these properties in the beam compromises the quality of the solution. Scaling factors were used to increase the modulus of the resin to compensate for the beam elements simplifications. While this scaling was a feasible solution for a simple load (loading in x-direction, loading in y-direction, or shear), different scaling factors were required for different loading conditions. This discrepancy indicated that the beam-shell model would not perform correctly under complex loading conditions and could not be used as a universal solution to model woven-fabric reinforced composites.

The methodology behind the double orthotropic-shell model was to discretize the contributions of the warp and weft yarns from the behavior of the overall composite. This ideology simplifies the woven fabric into two sets of unidirectional fibers that occupy the same physical space. Therefore, each set of fibers can be defined by orthotropic material properties and can be allowed to rotate independently of one another. This methodology generally predicted the same trends as those seen experimentally. A parametric study was performed to understand the influence of the material properties that are not easily predicted by the rule of mixtures: the shear modulus G
                     12 and the transverse modulus E
                     2. These factors were determined to significantly affect the trends demonstrated by the double orthotropic-shell model for composites reinforced by fabrics with high shear angles. Therefore, it is important to quantify these properties experimentally to create an accurate model. The double orthotropic-shell model demonstrates very promising potential, and a method for discretizing the overall behavior of the composite into discrete orthotropic materials should be developed.
