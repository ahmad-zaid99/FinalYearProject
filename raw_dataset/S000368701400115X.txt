Workstation design parameters

Group interaction

Engineering anthropometry

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  Past efforts have been made to design single-user workstations to accommodate users' anthropometric and preference distributions. However, there is a lack of methods for designing workstations for group interaction. This paper introduces a method for sizing workstations to allow for a personal work area for each user and a shared space for adjacent users. We first create a virtual population with the same anthropometric and preference distributions as an intended demographic of college-aged students. Members of the virtual population are randomly paired to test if their extended reaches overlap but their normal reaches do not. This process is repeated in a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the total percentage of groups in the population that will be accommodated for a workstation size. We apply our method to two test cases: in the first, we size polygonal workstations for two populations and, in the second, we dimension circular workstations for different group sizes.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The co-location of team members has been shown to increase teamwork quality and an effectively-designed workstation improves a team's productivity (Hoegl and Proserpio, 2004). Methods that utilize anthropometric data to size workstations have been developed for individual accommodation (Das and Grady, 1983a; Das and Sengupta, 1996; Pheasant, 1987; Sengupta and Das, 1997) However, methods are lacking for sizing workstations with respect to group accommodation and interaction.

Previous studies have considered anthropometric quantities in the design of single-user workstations (Das and Grady, 1983a; Pheasant, 1987; Das and Sengupta, 1996; Sengupta and Das, 1997). The arm length and stature of female populations have been used to determine the optimal placement and sizing of cashier stations (Das and Sengupta, 1996) and nurse stations (Pheasant, 1987). Additionally, manikin-based approaches have been used to simulate user behavior at single-user workstations (Sengupta and Das, 1997). Digital human models have been employed to design and visualize workstations and other products tailored to targeted population segments (HFES 300 Committee et al., 2004; Jung et al., 2009). Despite these numerous methods for sizing workstations, they all considered only the physical dimensions of a user to determine how far they can comfortably reach and did not account for the user's preference.

Wang highlighted user interaction with objects on a planar, static workspace and provided the fundamental research for “inner boundaries” (Wang, 1999). The inner boundary better defined the space needed by a seated user. It has been demonstrated that a user's reaching behavior is affected by an object's distance and weight (Choi and Mark, 2004). These two ideas are synthesized in the investigation of comfortable tabletop reach zones by Toney and Thomas (Toney and Thomas, 2006). No application of these findings has been used in conjunction with an anthropometric model to drive workstation design, although it has been cited as an idea for further investigation (Toney and Thomas, 2006).

Designing a workstation for a group is more complicated than for an individual: consideration must be given to both a user's personal space and the shared space between users (Scott et al., 2003; Sulaiman Kharrufa and Olivier, 2010; Tang, 1991). For example, each user needs space for their personal laptop and notebook, but also needs to be able to share reference manuals or rapid prototypes with other group members. Scott observed that “territories” — personal, group, and storage — arise naturally in a collaborative workspace setting (Scott, 2003; Scott et al., 2004). It is suggested that these emergent territories be used as guidelines in workstation design (Sulaiman Kharrufa and Olivier, 2010). These aforementioned studies observed subjects working in a collaborative environment and make broad suggestions about design considerations. However, they do not offer a systematic way to design such workstations.

Personal space at the workstation falls within each user's normal-reach zone (NRZ). Also known as the “normal working area,” the NRZ is generally defined as the area which can be comfortably reached while a seated user keeps their back upright. This size and shape of the zone has been modeled using anthropometric data and geometry (Das and Grady, 1983a,b; Pheasant and Haslegrave, 2005; Squires, 1956). The shared space on the workstation falls within a user's extended-reach zone (ERZ): the farthest a user can reach when their arm is fully extended and pivoting about the shoulder. Several studies have defined and modeled ERZs (Faulkner and Day, 1970; Sengupta and Das, 2000; Toney and Thomas, 2007). Empirically-based studies produced ranges of reach zone sizes based on a subject's stature percentile (Faulkner and Day, 1970; Sengupta and Das, 2000). However, the data is not available to correlate a subject's actual stature or other anthropometric data directly to their ERZ.

In this paper, we create a methodology for sizing workstations for effective group use. Specifically, we find the group accommodation as a function of the workstation's dimensions. This methodology considers the target users' anthropometric information with the goal that any two adjacently-seated members from the population have non-overlapping NRZs and a shared region created by the members' overlapping ERZs. For simplicity, we define the NRZ by the arc swept out by a user's wrist-wall length (WWL): the distance between the wall and the right wrist when standing with the back against the wall and the outstretched right arm parallel to the floor. For this paper, we define the ERZ as the 2D curve made of the farthest points a user can comfortably reach while: (1) their arm is fully extended, (2) they are bending at the waist and back, and (3) they are remaining seated. For the case studies in Sec. 3, we gathered preference data to determine ERZ as detailed in Sec. 2.2.

In a first test case of the methodology, we use two example populations to design three polygonal workstation configurations. The three configurations are: a four-seated workstation where users sit at the midpoint of each side (referred to as side-seated four-user workstation (SFU) and shown in Fig. 1
                     A), a four-seated workstation where users sit at the corners (referred to as corner-seated four-user workstation (CFU) and shown in Fig. 1B) and a three-seated workstation where users sit at the vertices (referred to as equilateral triangular three-user workstation (TTU) and shown in Fig. 1C). These three designs represent possible table layouts for an office or a library.

In a second test case, we apply the methodology to size circular workstations. We find the group accommodation as a function of workstation diameter for groups of three to six members. We use the results to find the dimensions that are optimal to accommodate multiple group sizes.

@&#METHODS@&#

The design method calculates the accommodation for groups in three steps. We (1) create a virtual population (Nadadur and Parkinson, 2009; Parkinson and Reed, 2010) based on the demographics of a target population, (2) calculate the ERZ for each member, and finally (3) calculate the accommodation of groups chosen from the virtual population. We detail each of these steps in the following subsections and present two test cases using the method in Sec. 3.

First a virtual population is created that reflects the anthropometric distributions, male-to-female ratio, and age range of a target demographic (e.g. college students, military personnel or the elderly). We start by using entries from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data set (1999–2006) (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008). It is assumed that the distribution of anthropometric measurements in NHANES is similar to that of the target population, but other data sets could be substituted. The original NHANES data set is split into male and female sets. The sets are then filtered to only include members within a specified age range or other anthropometric measure that matches the target demographic. The NHANES data set uses a weighting value for each measured subject so members of the virtual population are selected using a “roulette wheel” method: a randomized selection biased by the NHANES weighting values (Goldberg and Deb, 1991). Entries with a higher weighting are proportionately more likely to be selected for the virtual population than entries with lower weightings. A male set and female set are randomly selected from the original data set. The ratio of male to female members of the virtual population matches that of the target population. The gender, stature, and body mass index (BMI) are recorded for each selected member of the virtual population.

The virtual population does not yet have a value for their WWL as it is not included in the data from NHANES. We calculate WWL values for each member using linear regression models created from the US Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR) data (Gordon et al., 1989).

                           We did not use the ANSUR data for all anthropometric measures since the military personnel in the ANSUR survey will not match the anthropometric distributions of the target population in Sec. 3.
                         Separate regression models are created for calculating the WWL for men and women. The multivariate regression models use stature (denoted as S) in mm and BMI (denoted as B) in kg/m2 to find WWL (denoted as

                         values from Eqs. (1) and (2) indicate that WWL is correlated to stature and BMI but unexplained variance, not captured by these two measures, remains. Using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (Massey, 1951) on the residuals, we cannot reject the null-hypothesis at the 5% significance level that they are not normally distributed (
                           
                              p

                         for women). This result supports the assumption that the residuals are normally distributed.

A stochastic term is added to the models to account for the residual variance in the regression (Garneau and Parkinson, 2009; Parkinson and Reed, 2006; Reed et al., 2002). Because of the normally-distributed residuals, a random variable drawn from a normal distribution,

The stature and BMI of each member of the virtual population is used in Eq. (3) or (4), depending on gender, to create their corresponding WWL value. The WWL is used to calculate each member's ERZ in Sec. 2.2 and to test if members' NRZs overlap in Sec. 2.3.

The last quantity needed for the virtual population is the length of the ERZ for each member. One option for determining the ERZ would be to look it up in established tables (e.g. Sengupta and Das (2000) or Faulkner and Day (1970)). However, the available tables do not correlate anthropometric measures directly to ERZs. Instead, they offer a range of reach distances based on stature percentile. For the virtual population, we want every member to have their own ERZ determined by their anthropometric measures. Therefore, we conducted an experiment to gather reach data on a population whose anthropometric measurements were also recorded. This data allowed us to create a correlation between the anthropometric data and the reaching preference. The experiment was approved by The Pennsylvania State University's Institutional Review Board #36077.

For the experiment, subjects were asked to hold a

Both the workstation and seat were fixed in position and orientation during the experiment. Subjects completed two trials at each defined angle.

Summary demographics of the experimental subjects are provided in Table 1
                        . The subjects for the experiment were members of an engineering class (a target demographic in Sec. 3) and not recruited from the general student population. In this small study, there was a low number of female participants so the experimental data from men and women was pooled. For future applications, however, we recommend another experiment be run with a larger and more diverse subject pool. Using a large enough sample size, the reaching regression in the next step should be done separately for males and females.

Next, the subject's anthropometric data was correlated to their reaching preference data. The ERZ data from all twenty-one subjects is entered into an

Each member's anthropometry vector, 
                           X
                        , is constructed and placed it into Eq. (6). This is repeated for all members of the virtual population.

If the ERZ for values other than the five from the regression is required, a cubic spline is used to interpolate between values. A typical NRZ and ERZ for a population member is shown in Fig. 3
                        . It is assumes that the reach zones are symmetrical with respect to the left or right hand.

With all virtual population members having a NRZ (their WWL) and an ERZ, the accommodation percentage of groups seated at a workstation is calculated. First, the accommodation percentage of a pair seated at the workstation is found. A pair is considered accommodated if (1) their NRZs do not overlap and (2) their ERZs do overlap. To test the first condition, the sum of the two members' WWL lengths is compared to the shortest distance, d, between adjacent members. If the sum is less than d, there is no overlap. To test the second condition, each member's ERZ is calculated at the angle that d makes with a member's coronal axis. If the sum of the two ERZs is greater than d, the ERZs overlap.

The percent of accommodated pairs is calculated for a fixed-size workstation using a Monte Carlo simulation (Meteopolis and Ulam, 1949). First, pairs are randomly selected from members of the virtual population. For a given value of d, we determine whether each pair is accommodated. The percentage of accommodated pairs from the randomly-selected subset is used to estimate the percentage of pairs from the actual population that will be accommodated by the design. This pairing process is repeated across potential workstation sizes, changing the value of d each time.

Using this data, the percent accommodation is found as a function of side length. Finally, the percent accommodation of groups (i.e all adjacent pairs at the workstation) is calculated for the population: the probability of a single pair being accommodated is raised to the total number of adjacent pairs at the workstation.

Here, we apply the design methodology to workstations for populations at The Pennsylvania State University (University Park, PA). We first considered workstations at a meeting location frequented by the entire student body. For this scenario, the target population consists of a 54%/46% male-to-female split. We chose this ratio based on the composition of the entire university (U.S. News, 2011). Members aged only 18–30 are included to adequately represent “typical” college-aged students. For this virtual population,

                      females were randomly selected from the NHANES data set. The virtual population creation was done per the method in Sec. 2.1. The WWL and ERZ were then calculated for each member of the virtual population as described in Secs. 2.1 and 2.2 respectively.

For the first test case, the virtual populations is used to size each of the three workstation designs from Fig. 1. For SFU, pictured in Fig. 1A, the minimum distance between adjacent users is 
                           
                              d

                              L
                              
                                 2
                              
                              /
                              2
                           
                         with a reaching angle at 45∘ from the coronal axis. For CFU, pictured in Fig. 1B, the minimum distance between adjacent users is 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              L
                           
                         with a reaching angle at 45∘ from the coronal axis. For TTU, pictured in Fig. 1C, the minimum distance between adjacent users is 
                           
                              d
                              =
                              L
                           
                         with a reaching angle at 30∘ from the coronal axis.

The percent accommodation per side-length was determined via Monte Carlo simulation using 
                           
                              5

                                    10

                         random pairings (Using the method described in Sec. 2.3). This was repeated for each virtual population. The subset of pairs was tested for accommodation for side lengths from 100 cm to 350 cm in increments of 1 cm. The relationship between pair accommodation and side length for SFU is shown in Fig. 4
                        . For CFU, the relationship is shown in Fig. 5
                        . For TTU, the relationship is shown in Fig. 6
                        . For each plot, the black data points are accommodation levels based on the university (“Uni” in the figures) gender proportion (54%/46% male to female) while the gray data points are based on the College of Engineering (“Eng” in the figures) gender proportion (
                           
                              84.6

In the second test case, only the virtual population of the entire university was used. The diameter, D, of a circular workstation was varied. It was assumed that the members are all equidistant from each other, forming a normal polygon inscribed within the circle. For the number of group members seated at the workstation, n, the distance between adjacent members

                        . Tables for groups of three to six members were compared. The diameter was tested in the range of 100 cm–450 cm in increments of 1 cm. Results from the simulation for each of the four group sizes are shown in Fig. 7
                        . Each curve corresponds to a group size and shows the percentage of groups accommodated by a workstation diameter.

The results from the polygonal test case show that making the side length too small reduces accommodation by allowing NRZs to overlap. If the side length is too large, accommodation is reduced by having no overlap in users' ERZs. For each workstation design, there is a 30–50 cm range of side lengths that result in 
                        
                           100
                           %
                        
                      accommodation for groups. Outside this range, the accommodation is highly sensitive to side length and drops to 
                        
                           0
                           %
                        
                      accommodation within approximately 25 cm of either side of the plateau.

When comparing accommodations for each target population, the larger proportion of males in the engineering population shifts the curves toward larger side-length selections. Selecting side lengths that overlap at the 
                        
                           100
                           %
                        
                      accommodation level provides the best probability of the workstation design accommodating both populations.

We also observe that the physical dimensions for SFU are considerably larger than for CFU and TTU for equal group accommodation. A SFU workstation must have a larger side length by a factor of 
                        
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      compared to CFU. If the overall footprint of the workstation is a concern, the SFU uses its space less efficiently then than the other two polygonal geometries.

Results from the circular workstation test case in Fig. 7 show, as would be expected, that the table diameter needs to increase with the number of group members. We observe an overlap in the workstation diameters that fully accommodate sequential group sizes. If multiple workstation sizes were to be installed for this population, it would be most efficient to choose 225 cm, 264 cm and 306 cm to accommodate any group from three to six members.

The criteria for accommodation can be modified. For example, accommodation for this study was defined as any overlap of the ERZs of paired members. The definition could be changed to require a minimum value for this overlap. We defined NRZ as simply the area swept out by the WWL. This definition could be modified to better capture the region as described by the literature (e.g. Das and Grady (1983a,b), Pheasant and Haslegrave (2005), Squires (1956)).

The example populations consisted of men and women between ages 18 and 30. Therefore, using the NHANES data for the anthropometry was a suitable population source. Alternatively, the CAESAR (Robinette et al., 2002) data could be employed, or AnthroKids (Ressler, 1977) data if the workstation is for a younger population.

The subject pool used for the reaching experiment was limited. For further refinement of the method, it is recommended to perform the experiment with a larger, diverse subject pool and to test the ERZ at additional angles. This larger experiment should improve the regression estimate used to predict ERZ.

A method for workstation sizing has been demonstrated that considers the accommodation of groups from a population. By using anthropometry data of a target population (e.g. gender ratio or age range) a proper side length can be selected for an optimal multi-user workstation design. If multiple populations are expected to use the same design, it was demonstrated that there may be an intersection in side lengths that will accommodate each. Three polygonal workstation layouts and a circular workstation were presented as test cases, but any geometry can be considered by using the distance between users and their reaching angle.

The following are the three general steps of the workstation-sizing method as applied to the case study:
                        
                           1.
                           Create a virtual population with the same anthropometric distribution as the target demographic. In this case study, we used the NHANES and ANSUR data sets to obtain values for stature, BMI and WWL based on the gender ratio and age range of out target demographic. More measurements can be included depending on the definition of accommodation for the problem.

Create an ERZ for each member of the virtual population. For this study, the value was based on experimentally-obtained preference data that correlated the ERZ at various angles to stature, BMI and WWL. Alternatively, previously-created data sets and models could be employed such as those presented by Sengupta and Das (2000).

Randomly pair members of the virtual population at the workstation to test for accommodation in a Monte Carlo simulation. We defined a pair as accommodated if the members' NRZs do not overlap and their ERZs do overlap. For this study, the NRZ was defined by the arc swept out by a member's WWL. This definition can be altered depending on the needs of the problem. Additional sizing criteria for the workstation can be considered, such as the height. Use the simulation to estimate the percent of pairs from the actual population that will be accommodated.

Although we presented the design method as an application for sizing tabletop workstations, it can be applied to other sceneries where resources are shared between users. For example, the placement of controls and instruments can be determined for vehicles that feature both individual and shared controls including automobiles, aircraft cockpits and heavy machinery. Additionally, the location of machinery, tools and materials can be optimized for manufacturing-workstations where workers need to share equipment and pass works in progress to each other. Finally, accommodation for people in wheelchairs can be included in workstation sizing by modifying how their NRZ and ERZ are determined.
