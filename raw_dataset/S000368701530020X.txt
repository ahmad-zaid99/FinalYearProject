Patient identification armbands

Patient armband design

Patient safety

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  The task of patient identification is performed many times each day by nurses and other members of the care team. Armbands are used for both direct verification and barcode scanning during patient identification. Armbands and information layout are critical to reducing patient identification errors and dangerous workarounds. We report the effort at two large, integrated healthcare systems that employed human factors engineering approaches to the information layout design of new patient identification armbands. The different methods used illustrate potential pathways to obtain standardized armbands across healthcare systems that incorporate human factors principles. By extension, how the designs have been adopted provides examples of how to incorporate human factors engineering into key clinical processes.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The task of patient identification is performed frequently by nurses and other members of the care team each day and is essential for patient safety. Patient misidentification and associated preventable patient harm occurs daily nationwide with potentially fatal consequences (Gray et al., 2006; Schulmeister, 2008). Errors in the identification process can occur in a myriad of care encounters, such as blood transfusion, medication administration and specimen collection (Mannos, 2003; Pagliara and Rubella, 2006; Valenstein et al., 2006). In response to risks of misidentification, the Joint Commission established as one of its National Patient Safety Goals (NPSGs) the “use of at least two patient identifiers (e.g., patient name and date of birth) when administering medications, blood, or blood components; when collecting blood samples and other specimens for clinical testing; and when providing treatments or procedures. The patient's room number or physical location is not used as an identifier” (Joint Commission, 2014).

Identification armbands have been used for ensuring compliance to NPSGs. Organizations have modified armbands to contain key “patient identifiers” in order to support the “two identifiers” requirement by NPSGs (Joint Commission, 2014). To further enhance safety, organizations have paired patient armbands with scanning technology, such as barcode medication administration (BCMA), to reduce medication errors (Akiyama et al., 2010). Barcode medication administration requires a clinician to electronically verify that the correct patient is being given the right dose of the prescribed medication at the accurate time by scanning both the patient identification armband and each medication being administered.

The optimal design of data elements and their layout on patient armbands is essential for patient identification (Dhatt et al., 2011). Previous studies have identified several potential sources of error with armband use, such as the omission of key information or the display of unreadable information (Burrows et al., 2009; Linden, 1998; Lumadue et al., 1997). Poor design, such as suboptimal barcode orientation (Snyder et al., 2010), has been linked to medication errors (Bauer and Guerlain, 2011; Orser et al., 2001). Optimizing barcode width and layout in addition to implementing process changes and specific staff training has been shown to reduce patient identification errors (Colard, 2005), improve efficiency, and allow staff to focus more on direct patient care activities (Keohane et al., 2008).

One feature of well-designed armbands is their ability to be scanned quickly and accurately. Specific scanning technology used in BCMA necessitates re-engineering the space, layout and content on the armband. The inability to successfully scan barcodes frustrates users, reduces efficiency and can delay the administration of essential medications to patients (Johnson et al., 2002). In one instance, unsuccessful attempts to scan certain Large Volume Parenteral (LVP) bags for product identification were traced back to problematic barcode placement (Raman et al., 2011). Furthermore, if patient armbands do not scan in as few as one or two attempts, nurses will resort to workarounds such as attaching a patient's identification barcode to something other than the patient to make it easier to access (DiConsiglio, 2008; Koppel et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011).

One challenge in the re-engineering of armband layout for enhanced barcode scanning is that these changes can compromise the readability of armbands. In some cases, enhancing barcode scanning might actually decrease human readability, such as when barcodes take up so much space on the armband that font is too small to be easily read by staff. Reports of implementation efforts of BCMA systems indicated that successful implementation relies upon usable, easy to read patient identification armbands (Miller et al., 2011). Note that human reading of armbands is required for direct patient identification and as a backup method when BCMA is not working, such as during system downtimes.

Despite the importance of optimal armband design to patient safety, there are no published guidelines or testing processes for a safe, usable patient armband design. User testing is advocated to identify usability issues (ISO 9241-11, 1998; Patterson et al., 2006) and should be integrated into design processes (Preece et al., 2007), but with the exception of one report of simulation-based usability testing comparing commercial barcode technology systems for transfusion (Anders et al., 2011), healthcare systems have few examples to follow when attempting to design, test and implement patient identification armbands.

In this article we report efforts at two independent, multi-facility healthcare systems utilizing different human factors engineering approaches to develop new processes for patient identification armband design. We outline the human factors principles involved in design and the practical barriers in implementation. At both healthcare systems (referred to as Sites 1 and 2), the goal was to achieve a single, system-wide armband design using human factors guidelines and recommendations when feasible. A standardized armband design was considered more cost effective and less complex to maintain, with the intended benefit of consistency for staff that may work at different facilities within a system.

Site 1 was a nonprofit integrated health care delivery system consisting of 12 acute care hospitals. Site 2 was a nonprofit healthcare delivery system consisting of 12 hospitals. Both sites independently formed multidisciplinary teams to prototype and evaluate the design layout of new patient identification armbands. The two sites collaborated by sharing armband standards and requirements as well as de-identified prototypes for comparison purposes.

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The design effort was triggered by the purchasing department's decision to consolidate all facilities to a single patient armband vendor. Previously, each facility designed and chose its own patient armbands. As the start of the effort, the corporate Office of Patient Safety was consulted and recommended that human factors experts be included. The multidisciplinary team consisted of human factors engineers, patient safety nurses, an informatics resource nurse, a software developer familiar with the armband configuration software, the director of supply chain management and an information systems manager. Key activities included: (a) comparing different armband layouts and data elements used at facilities to identify common elements, (b) interviewing and observing users to determine which data elements on armbands were actually used and (c) reviewing the literature and national standards to determine the core data elements to comply with NPSGs. An iterative design process was employed for the team to work within the constraints of the armband design software, while finding solutions to best include data elements required following human factors design principles.

The data elements in existing armbands varied across facilities (Fig. 1
                           ). For example, the admitting physician's name was included at one facility so that staff could easily clarify orders or discuss a patient's treatment with physicians. Staff were found to utilize different data elements when reviewing patient armbands. For example, laboratory staff used the patient's visit number, which is unique to a specific patient visit and account, instead of the medical record number for matching laboratory draw orders. Through usability inspection, we found issues pertaining to the readability/usability of the two patient identifiers, name and date of birth, such as variations in locations, difficult to find core data elements (e.g., non-bold, similar size font), reduced readability due to all upper-case letters and cluttered with too much information (e.g., area of care, name of admitting physician).

We encountered major armband design software limitations in layout, formatting and spacing. Multiple iterations resulted in an ‘ideal’ prototype armband design (Fig. 2
                           ). To support ease of use, the ideal prototype improved the readability of the two key patient identifiers, name and date of birth, by placing them at the top of the armband and formatting them to promote key information retrieval (e.g., bold, larger font size). We capitalized only the patient's last name to enhance visual scanning for the core data elements. The prototype reduced clutter by stripping all non-essential elements for patient identification (e.g., area of care, admitting physician's name). Finally, the barcode was given a prominent, easy to scan location and made as large as possible.

The simulation-based usability test was conducted to compare a design in use at three facilities with the ideal prototype. It should be noted that the evaluation effort was Site 1's first attempt to incorporate simulation-based usability testing to inform design decisions.

The participants were 10 nurses (9 females and 1 male) recruited at a monthly system-wide health information technology (HIT) meeting. These nurses were specially trained in informatics and remain active in nursing practice (minimum of two patient care shifts per month to remain current on patient care practices and staff workflows). Informatics training included “super user” training on the electronic health record (EHR) and BCMA. As part of their responsibilities, these nurses conduct functionality testing on new EHR modules, support user training and provide on-site education at their assigned facility. Their background was ideal for evaluating the new patient armband designs, as they were well versed in the needs, workflows and common issues faced by staff with BCMA. By utilizing a recurring system meeting, held at one of the system's hospitals, the testing team was able to set up a real-world testing space via an unoccupied patient room with participants already present at the meeting. We did not record demographic information other than gender.

Three handheld scanning devices were employed to simulate real-world utilization of the armbands: a BCMA scanner, a blood glucose scanner and a laboratory scanner. Each scanner was paired with a laptop with access to the EHR test environment in order to determine if a successful scan of each armband occurred.

Participants completed all scenario-based scanning tasks on each of the three scanners for both armbands. The order in which the scanners and armbands were tested was counterbalanced across participants, with the number of attempts needed for a successful barcode scan on each device recorded. The participants were then asked to rate the following features of the armbands on a Likert scale: how easy they were to read, the ability of each armband to facilitate quick task completion and their confidence when using each armband (Appendix A). Participants were then asked the four interview questions: which armband they preferred, what they liked best and least about their chosen armband, and what additional data elements (if any) should be included. Finally, participants were given the opportunity for any additional comments or insights they wished to share with the testing team.

A tool was used to capture the number of scans needed for each of the three devices to register a successful barcode capture and collect participant responses to survey and interview questions (Appendix A). An empty patient room was used as the simulated environment, which ensured that the armbands and scanners were evaluated in a realistic setting where issues such as lighting, hardware placement and staff access to the patient were representative of actual armband utilization. A member of the testing team simulated a patient by wearing the armbands and lying in the patient bed.

The primary dependent variable captured during the simulation-based usability test was the number of barcode scans required for the three handheld devices - the barcode medication administration scanner, the blood glucose scanner and the laboratory scanner - to register a successful barcode capture on each armband (Table 1
                           ).

The number of scan attempts required to register a successful barcode reading with the three devices was compared with a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results indicated that the prototype band required fewer scan attempts to register a successful barcode reading and was therefore more efficient, z = 2.12, p < .05.

User ratings were compared with paired samples t tests adjusted for multiple comparisons. The mean rating on the prototype band's ability to easily be read (M = 4.90, SD = 0.32) was significantly higher than the current band's (M = 3.40, SD = 1.17), t (9) = −4.03, p < .01, the mean rating of the prototype's ability to facilitate quick use and task completion (M = 4.70, SD = 0.48) was significantly greater than the current armband's (M = 3.11, SD = 1.17), t (9) = −3.78, p < .01, and user confidence when utilizing the prototype armband was significantly higher (M = 4.60, SD = 0.70) than with the current armband (M = 3.40, SD = 1.07), t (9) = −3.67, p < .01 (Table 2
                           ). Furthermore, all 10 participants indicated they favored the prototype over the current armband design when asked to choose which armband they would prefer.

Participants provided comments. The most common participant response was that the prototype was easier to read (mentioned by 6 participants): “The newer band is much easier to read, I don't have to squint.” Participants also appreciated that the prototype had less clutter (mentioned by 4 participants): “This new band has much more white space than the old one, it's easier to look for what I need to find.” The enhanced presentation of the two key patient identifiers, patient name and date of birth, was also valued by participants (mentioned by 3 participants): “I like that the name and date of birth are on the top, which makes them easy to find.”

@&#BACKGROUND@&#

The design effort was triggered by an improvement effort surrounding patient identification practices in one Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Site 2. A human factors specialist was consulted to identify barriers and propose solutions for patient identification in the NICU. In this NICU, lighting is low and small armbands are used on patients. The team leveraged a parallel system-wide initiative to implement BCMA to improve the design of patient armbands.

A small multidisciplinary team was formed to evaluate the current armbands and develop an initial prototype. This team included an information technology specialist who programmed the armband design and was knowledgeable about the software limitations, a patient safety specialist and a human factors engineer.

Several usability issues were identified with the armband currently in use (Fig. 3
                           ). The 6-point font was difficult to read, especially under low-light conditions. The patient account number was ten digits long with no spacing to facilitate the chunking of information. Additionally, the armband was cluttered with unnecessary information and space was crowded by six identical barcodes as a way to improve scanning.

Based on this evaluation, the team proposed that the information should be presented in a sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica) in at least 12-point font size to improve readability and that data should be grouped spatially to improve task verification. The team also recommended that the long, 12 digit medical record number be broken into 3 or 4 digit chunks to make it easier for staff to identify and retain for verification (Cowan, 2010). In order to maintain these recommendations, the system was advised to develop a standard for printed critical patient information including the unique identifiers used on patient armbands and determine an approval process for requests to modify the size, use of space and layout of armbands.

The team developed several mockup configurations as aides to evaluate the tradeoffs between strict adherence to the design guidelines and the limitations inherent in the design software, such as having to utilize lower case for patient name and the inability to group digits in small chunks (Fig. 4
                           ). For example, the software system mandated that medical record numbers be increased from 10 to 12 digits. The team requested a break or dash in the 12 digit medical record number to facilitate staff's ability to chunk the information (Cowan, 2010). A potential design option within software limitations was a single space between six consecutive digits.

The initial prototype was reviewed with frontline staff. It was discovered that staff interpreted the 12 digit medical record number displayed as two groups as two distinct numbers. Due to this, the prototype was revised by underlining all twelve digits to link them into a single number. Staff were again engaged, and the addition of the underlined text was found to have the desired effect of staff interpreting the 12 digits as a single number. The font size of critical information (the two key patient identifiers) was also increased from 6-point to 12-point font. Information not needed for positive patient identification, such as the physician's name, was removed to reduce clutter (Fig. 5
                           ).

The approved prototype was trialed at two hospitals within Site 2's system for three months. Following the trial period, an enterprise-wide meeting was held in an attempt to standardize the armband design throughout all 12 facilities. During the meeting, the armband design was further improved to reflect the needs of end users. For example, additional patient information, such as age and gender, was requested by staff and added to the prototype armband.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The experience at two multi-facility healthcare systems demonstrated the novel application of human factors engineering approaches to patient identification armband design efforts and resulted in the prototyping and testing of new enterprise armbands. To our knowledge, the formal simulation-based usability test reported here was a first in informing patient identification armband design recommendations. Human factors engineering is a novel approach to implement non-specific national and regulatory standards. Methods such as usability testing may be common in industries where usability and user-centric design is well accepted. In healthcare, however, usability concepts are not well entrenched and as a result the end user experience is rarely considered.

A common tactic at both systems was to harness a myriad of different team members’ skills in regulatory compliance, BCMA armband design systems and deployment. The value in applying human factors expertise, analysis and principles was improved design of patient identification armbands. With minimal published examples to act as a guide, we believe that these two case studies can provide strategies for healthcare systems. The extended timeline at Site 1 allowed a simulation-based usability test opportunistically arranged at an existing meeting. Usability testing provided stronger recommendations to decision makers on how the new patient armbands should be designed based on how staff would actually utilize the new armbands. Site 2 took the approach of piloting in two facilities to seek user feedback. The design was in conjunction with BCMA implementation to improve patient identification practices through both technological implementation as well as improved usability of patient identification armbands.

Our application of human factors approaches highlights the principles for patient identification armband design:
                           
                              1.
                              Simplify to eliminate unnecessary information not utilized for positive patient identification

Locate patient name and date of birth, and any other approved unique identifiers, in easy to find places

Use large font sizes and style (e.g., 12-point sans serif font)

Standardize information layout and presentation to reduce potential staff confusion

Avoid utilizing all caps for displaying patient identifiers to maximize readability

Software limitations at both sites required some critical concessions from design teams. For example, we were unable to utilize the entire space and leave extra margins for perforations. As another example, we were unable to chunk a 12 digit medical record number into 4 digit strings. These barriers encourage additional support for studies like those presented here to generate recommendations to technology and software development vendors to proactively optimize product design while allowing for maximum customizability.

The teams at the two sites were able to adapt to practical constraints. For Site 1, the team was given only one type and brand of armband to optimize, which limited the feasible solutions the team was able to explore. Secondly, a small number of participants (10) were available for the simulation-based usability test, at the risk that the participants were not an adequate representative sample of the frontline staff population. However, despite the relatively low number of participants, we feel it was a strength, not a limitation, to have conducted the usability test with real nurses given the lack of infrastructure for testing of this nature within healthcare systems. We included nurses over the age of 50 to seek feedback on the prototype armband design (Buerhaus et al., 2013). These frontline nursing representatives ensured that the approved armband elements were readable in a variety of conditions, including low-light care areas such as a NICU. Although we were unable to include laboratory staff members, our analysis showed that laboratory staff rely on patient armbands for different information purposes than nurses.

At Site 2, the decision was made to pilot and then modify patient armbands without simulation-based usability testing. No quantitative data were collected. Instead, the team relied on staff feedback to inform their efforts throughout the design process, such as the addition of commonly used data elements (e.g., patient age).

Human factors engineering can provide methods and concepts to guide healthcare systems in patient identification armband designs. Here, two healthcare systems employed human factors expertise to implement new enterprise patient armbands that could facilitate BCMA while simultaneously supporting ancillary staff use. Both sites formed multidisciplinary teams that could take advantage of many different perspectives and levels of expertise while following human factors design principles to arrive at design recommendations. These recommendations provided an achievable layout and realistic understanding of how the information would be utilized prior to making a final decision for both sites.

As technological systems designed to enhance patient safety continue to permeate healthcare (e.g., BCMA), structured approaches to evaluating these systems through user-centric and human factors design processes will save healthcare systems and their staff time, effort, monetary expense and end user frustration that could lead to dangerous workarounds and deleterious impacts to patient safety (DiConsiglio, 2008; Koppel et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011). Further, by incorporating human factors engineering approaches such as simulation-based usability testing and trial use periods, healthcare organizations can provide realistic usage data to design efforts that can result in better products that support staff use and promote patient safety. Other healthcare systems may benefit from strategies and tactics described here.

Future research should be focused on the impact of improved patient identification armband design to patient safety. Determining whether an optimized identification armband results in fewer instances of patient misidentification or fewer medication errors would add to the evidence presented here that human factors approaches to identification and armband design can foster improvements in the care continuum.
