@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  For several 3D data applications such as data-hiding or compression, data ordering is a major problem. We need to know how to achieve the same 3D mesh path between the coding and decoding stages. Various algorithms have been proposed in recent years, but we focus on methods based on Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees (EMST). In this paper, we analyse the sensitivity of the EMST structure to obtain a more robust synchronization. We present a new theoretical analysis and a way to visualize EMST robustness. Moreover, this analysis can be useful in 3D data-hiding in order to detect fragile area and to predict the 3D object robustness during transmission on a noisy channel.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Internet is very useful for broadcasting multimedia information. There are more and more 3D object exchanges in computer graphics, CAO and video games. Therefore, it is essential to produce efficient techniques for protecting, visualizing, sharing, printing and modifying these 3D objects. For these applications, it could be important to have a single 3D mesh path which orders the vertices. In this domain, this vertex ordering step is often called the synchronization step. Indeed, contrary to the 2D imaging field, where there is a trivial path with rows and columns, the case of 3D objects is more complex, even though the 3D mesh is semi-regular or regular. For example, in 3D data-hiding, it is essential to locate where the binary embedded data is distributed. This kind of path is used for synchronization with the aim of keeping the same order at inserting and extracting stages. A survey of 3D watermarking techniques has been proposed by Wang et al.  [1]. Watermarking techniques are interesting to protect the file content and also to embed meta-data. Data-hiding may be a way to have new functionalities, i.e. keeping the standard format without increasing the size. Another example of the benefits of having a single 3D mesh path is to produce a deterministic traversal of the mesh for 3D compression, as presented in a survey by Peng et al.  [2].

The step which gives a mesh order is one of the main difficulties in compression, watermarking or visualization. Furthermore, in some specialized areas (medicine, industry), the position of vertices and the connectivity between them (in the 3D mesh) should not be affected by the path building process. Various methods have been proposed, but we are interested by the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) method proposed by Amat et al.  [3]. The authors proposed a scheme which does not move any mesh vertex. They used an EMST to be able to scan the mesh in a unique manner for data synchronization.

Since the method is fragile, an EMST sensitivity analysis is necessary to determine the robustness threshold of an EMST-based on a 3D mesh. In this paper, we analysed the EMST sensitivity by computing how a vertex can be moved without changing the connections in the EMST. Since the problem is very difficult, we made some assumptions in order to make it tractable. It may also be interesting to quantify the EMST robustness. A sensitive analysis can be useful for some applications such as 3D reconstruction  [4], 2D object recognition and classification  [5], watermarking  [3,6], compression  [7] and segmentation  [8]. For example, the proposed analysis could be used to improve the choice of the mark vertex selecting proposed by Wang et al.  [9].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we deal with the 3D path building issue. We present various classes of techniques, such as the synchronization by data structure (EMST). In Section  3, we present the problem of EMST sensitivity. Then, in Section  4, we propose a new approach to this problem by analysing the displacement of the vertex at each step of Prim’s algorithm  [10]. We assessed our theory in order to quantify the displacement of the vertices. The results are given in Section  5 and our approach is validated. The discussion is concluded in Section  6 and future work directions are mentioned.

3D processing is a comparatively new multimedia research field. One of the main problems in these applications is the ordering of 3D model data. In this section, we present ordering techniques based on a single path of 3D model. First, we present methods which only perform a path on a part of the mesh. Then we introduce some methods which order the patches created on the mesh. Finally, we present techniques that define a path along all vertices of the mesh.

One of the first paths for data-hiding watermarking techniques was proposed by Ohbuchi et al.  [11]. The algorithm and synchronization of the embedded message are quite simple. The idea, illustrated in Fig. 1
                        , consists of duplicate facets of the mesh along a band that encodes the message. To start the duplication, a starting edge and an orientation of the triangles must be defined. To encode a ‘0’, from the current edge, they have to duplicate the first edge they meet during the exploration, and for embedding a ‘1’ they have to duplicate the second edge. The duplicated edge becomes the current one and the algorithm continues until all bits of the message are embedded.

With this approach, the mark is robust to geometrical modifications such translation, rotation and scaling. But it is visible and easily detectable, i.e. the algorithm is not secure. Moreover, vertices and facets are added and the size of the mesh increases as a function of the message size. Nevertheless, it is one of the first paths proposed for 3D blind data-hiding methods.

The idea behind creating a band, or performing a scan on the mesh to synchronize the hidden message is classic reasoning. For example, Mao et al.  [12] and Cayre et al.  [13] proposed almost the same approach to scan the mesh.

In the approach proposed by Mao et al., they built a triangle path in the mesh to synchronize the data to be embedded, as illustrated in Fig. 2
                        . They selected a starting triangle 
                           Δ
                        , an edge 
                           e
                         of 
                           Δ
                        , and an orientation of this triangle. At each step, they choose one of the neighbour triangles as a function of the orientation and the previous step. From the current edge 
                           c
                        , they scan the triangle in the direction of the orientation and select the last edge 
                           e
                         of the current triangle 
                           Δ
                        . Then they select the neighbouring triangle 
                           
                              
                                 Δ
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        , if it exists, such that 
                           e
                         is the common edge between 
                           Δ
                         and 
                           
                              
                                 Δ
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                        . Then 
                           
                              
                                 Δ
                              
                              
                                 ′
                              
                           
                         becomes the current triangle, and will be scanned in the opposite direction. The orientation to scan the triangle alternates as illustrated in Fig. 2. The operation continues until we do not need triangles to embed the hidden message.

In principle, this method does not create geometric error. However, the watermark can be detectable because it is a high density area in the mesh. Furthermore, such methods are obviously not robust against connectivity attacks.

In this section, we present some methods that create patches on the 3D mesh. This is an interesting approach to deal with certain constraints in the 3D mesh area such as malicious attacks or visible deformations induced by watermarking for example. In segmentation areas, a 3D mesh is partitioned following the model semantics. For example, Tierny et al.  [14] proposed a method based on construction of the skeleton of the mesh that produces a small number of patches. These patches are quite semantically correct, but there are few of them and they are not ordered. Defining a path in a mesh requires a higher number of patches and a very deterministic algorithm.

Luo and Bors  [15] proposed an efficient watermarking scheme based on regions of equal geodesic distance. These distances are calculated from a chosen vertex (in red in Fig. 3
                        ).

Each strip in Fig. 3(b) is used for embedding a single bit, while the region around the source, which is shown in blue, is trimmed away. Patches are created thanks to their geodesic distance from a vertex, so they are ordered by construction.

Wang et al.  [16] proposed another synchronization for their watermarking method that is based on generating a cylindrical system patch by discretizing its 
                           h
                         and 
                           θ
                         domains. Patches are ordered according to their spatial locations. In another paper, Wang et al.  [17] proposed to use manifold harmonics and to quantify the amplitudes of some low frequencies coefficients in order to hide a 16-bit watermark (see Fig. 4
                        ).

The Edgebreaker mesh compression algorithm proposed by Rossignac  [18] is a mono-resolution algorithm, i.e. it does not allow access before full load. It puts the vertices and facets in order at the same time without redundancy, as illustrated in Fig. 5
                        . The scan is also unique, as it depends on the first vertex and the first triangle chosen.

This technique is based on region growing that incrementally encodes facets and their relations. Thanks to this algorithm, we obtain a unique sequence of vertices that totally defines the mesh.

To illustrate the need for a well defined order in a 3-D mesh, we present two watermarking techniques which are based on previous synchronization methods. The watermarking of Bogomjakov et al.  [19] is based on swapping elements in the file. The synchronization step can be done by any kind of deterministic mesh traversal and they use the traversal performed by the Edgebreaker   [18] algorithm. This example shows that ordering vertices of a 3-D mesh in a robust way is a relevant goal to produce more and more applications in this area. Another method proposed by Wang and Men illustrates that the synchronization is determined only by the file ordering  [20].

In the method proposed by Amat et al.  [3], data embedding in the mesh is based on modification of the connection between the vertices in the mesh, without moving the vertices. In order to synchronize the message, an EMST is computed. Fig. 6
                        (a) illustrates the EMST of a horse mesh (504 vertices). The EMST is unique, depending on a seed vertex 
                           
                              
                                 v
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                        , while the path of vertices is also unique. This can be a synchronization tool because we can scan the EMST with a single path. Amat et al.  [3] selected quadruples, a vertex and its three sons in the EMST to embed one bit per quadruple, if possible. In order to avoid visual distortion and desynchronization, the quadruples must verify three conditions: coplanarity, the measure of the angle formed by the two triangles must be close to 0; convexity, to scan the same geometrical space; and if two quadruples are neighbours or overlapped, then only one of them is used for the embedding.

However, this method produces fragile watermarking, i.e. if the mesh is modified then the watermark is not extractable. The problem is to know how this method is stable. Indeed, if it is fragile enough to detect any modification. Conversely, we want to know how the method is robust against vertex displacement in order to find new tracks for robust watermarking. We focus on this original method to quantify the fragility of the data synchronization by studying the robustness of the EMST. Indeed, as we can see Fig. 6(b) which is the EMST of the noisy horse mesh with 
                           σ
                           =
                           1
                           
                              
                                 0
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 2
                              
                           
                        , the EMST computed on a mesh is very sensitive to vertex displacement. Fig. 6(c) illustrates the comparison between the original horse mesh and the noisy one. The problem is well known in the graph theory for the minimum spanning tree (MST), but has not been very well studied in the geometrical case (i.e. EMST). We discuss the state of the art of the analysis of the MST sensitivity in Section  3.

In this section, we present how the problem of EMST sensitivity may be defined with various approaches.

As per this paper, we have taken a cloud of vertices 
                           V
                         and explored how we can move a vertex in space without changing the connections

The Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a well-known problem in graph theory. It is a polynomial problem that is solved by two famous algorithms, i.e Prim’s  [10] and Kruskal’s  [21]. For a given MST 
                           T
                        , it is interesting to know which connections are fragile, and which are not. The MST sensitivity problem may answer this question. MST sensitivity is also a polynomial problem. In this section, we have presented an approach for solving the problem and we draw a conclusion for our application.

For Gordeev  [22,23], the MST sensitivity analysis is an optimization problem based on matroids. The aim is to determine the maximum intensity of a disruptive vector such that the solution of the optimization problem remains a solution after the perturbation. Gordeev considers the following model: let

The aim of Yaman et al.  [25] is to introduce a robust version of the MST where the edge costs are specified as interval numbers. It is a spanning tree such that the weight of the tree minimizes the maximum deviation from the MST. They introduce the notion of a weak tree, and it is an MST for some scenarios. In other words, for different edge valuations, the weak tree is not always an MST. Then, an edge is a weak edge if it lies on some weak tree. On the contrary, an edge is a strong edge if it lies on an MST for all possible edge evaluations. Their goal is to define a robust spanning tree, so they introduce two robustness measures for the MST problem, “absolute robustness” and “relative robustness”. These measures are used to characterize the worst case scenario, and then they use mixed integer programming to find a robust spanning tree. This method is very interesting for small graphs but it has huge complexity.

For each step of the Prim’s algorithm, we want to compute the area in which the vertex

                         can be moved without changing the connection in the EMST. This area depends on the seed vertex (denoted

                         illustrates that the EMST changes when a vertex moves too much. Distinguish EMST between the vertex ordering is necessary to well understand the analysis. Nevertheless, we point out that the ordering given by Prim’s algorithm is dramatically dependent of the EMST stability.

In Sections  4.1 and 4.2, we defined two radii of displacement

                        . In order to have a single measure of the possible vertex displacement without changing the EMST, we need to verify all the conditions that allow us to compute these parameters independently of the displacement direction.

Then, in Section  5.2 we present a full example with the 3D object Horse and an analysis of the vertex displacement to comment the results. We also present the result of our analysis by viewing the robust areas on the 3D object Horse. Finally, in Section  5.3 we validate the experimental results with the proposed theoretical analysis.

For the experiments, we used a database consisting of more than 20 3D meshes selected from various sources (Stanford University Graphics Laboratory,

                         in general. But the distribution of the most robust vertices does not change. We choose the first vertex as a parameter, it could be used to define a different order on the EMST. Moreover, we have defined a scope where the EMST does not change, in this context the vertex ordering done by the Prim algorithm is stable. However, we are aware that modifying the EMST could change dramatically the order defined, even if the percentage of common edge is high.

In order to reduce the complexity and to compare these meshes, we sub-sampled them to have approximately 1000 vertices for each 3D mesh. Indeed, for larger 3D objects, we assumed that is always possible to sub-sample them to keep the most interesting vertices. This can be done by a simple decimation, or on a sub-resolution or a clustering method. In fact the complexity of the analysis of EMST algorithm is in

                         are close to zero. As the radius value of a vertex becomes more significant, this vertex can be moved more and ultimately be more robust. However, the results illustrated in Fig. 12(a) and (c) show that a significant part of the vertices can be moved, but this also reveals the fragility of EMST structures.

                         seem to be the same for the seven objects we analysed. The main part of the vertices cannot be moved, as we have previously seen for the 3D object Horse, but some of them can be moved. In particular, for criterion

                        , we also notice the same shape as Horse. Indeed, a lot of vertices cannot be moved, but we observed a peak around a particular value which corresponds to the average distance between two vertices. In Fig. 13(c), we can validate this intuition because the peak is around the same value. Indeed, this peak is a function of the average distance between two vertices of the mesh.

In order to determine how a vertex can be moved, we propose to let a criterion 
                           r
                         quantify the possible motion of each vertex. Thus, for each vertex, we calculate:

In Fig. 15
                         we visualized the more robust vertices in order to locate the most robust areas. These mesh parts could be used to synchronize hidden data during a watermarking process for example. Fig. 15(a) and (c) illustrates the original mesh of the 3D object Horse, while Fig. 15(b) and (d) illustrates the result of the visualization. The darker colours correspond to the most fragile areas, whereas the lighter colours correspond to the most robust areas.

As we can notice, a large number of areas, illustrated in darker colour, seem to be rather fragile. We can also notice, for the most robust areas, that the space between them and their neighbourhoods are not regular. This might be a clue for the search of geometrical criteria.

To validate our proposed theory, we need to have a relationship between the theoretical criteria as a function of

In future work, it will be interesting to formalize this study in a theoretical context. This kind of technique should be interesting with various criteria that we are studying, such as estimation of the discrete curvature. The aim is to find a stable criterion in order to use the synchronization in a robust watermarking scheme.

In this paper, we have presented a theoretical analysis of the displacement of vertices without changing the connections in the EMST. Moreover, we have proposed a theoretical criterion in line with the Gaussian noise model in order to select the

                     ,Assumption 3.2 and we assumed that this analysis can be done independently for each vertex, Assumption 3.1. These assumptions are not too much restrictive in the case of watermarking and compression applications where each vertex is processed one by one. In particular, with this analysis, we are able to locate robust areas that could be used for message embedding with the watermarking technique proposed by Amat et al.  [3].

To continue this work, from a theoretical standpoint, it would be interesting to reduce the chosen constraints of our study. For a given step of Prim’s algorithm, we would like to know how to move the vertex in three dimensions without changing the EMST built in the previous steps and without any a priori or hypotheses about these steps.

We would also like to link this study with 3D robust watermarking in order to build a new synchronization technique using EMST. This is a challenge since EMST is a fragile approach. For example, it might be interesting to build a tree with only the most robust areas for synchronization with the aim of being robust against attacks. Of course, the synchronization is strongly connected with the watermarking method and the application. For example, Su et al. proposed a very specific watermarking method for CAPD where the synchronization is a function of the flow direction  [26].
