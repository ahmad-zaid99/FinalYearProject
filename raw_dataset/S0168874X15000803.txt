@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  Two porous plasticity models, Rousselier and Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman (GTN), are integrated with a new semi-implicit integration algorithm for finite strain plasticity. It consists of using relative Green–Lagrange during the iteration process and incremental frame updating corresponding to a polar decomposition. Lowdin׳s method of orthogonalization is adopted to ensure incremental frame-invariance. In addition, a smooth replacement of the complementarity condition is used. Since porous models are known to be difficult to integrate due to the combined effect of void fraction growth, stress and effective plastic strain evolution, we perform a complete assessment of our semi-implicit algorithm. Semi-implicit algorithms take advantage of different evolution rates to enhance the robustness in difficult to converge problems. A detailed description of the constitutive algorithm is performed, with the key components comprehensively exposed. In addition to the fully detailed constitutive algorithms, we use mixed finite strain elements based on Arnold׳s MINI formulation. This formulation passes the inf–sup test and allows a direct application with porous models. Isoerror maps for two common initial stress states are shown. In addition, we extensively test the two models with established benchmarks. Specifically, the cylindrical tension test as well as the butterfly shear specimen are adopted for validation. A 3D tension test is used to investigate mesh dependence and the effect of a length scale. Results show remarkable robustness.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

For common metals at room temperature, void nucleation and particle debonding, void growth and coalescence are the mechanisms for crack growth from the process region [10]. Detailed multiple-scale analysis of these mechanisms require robust polycrystalline plasticity and representation of dislocation dynamics and grain boundary barriers (Roters et al. [30] present a comprehensive review). Therefore, the so-called phenomenological models (e.g. [18]) are considered a cost-effective tool for predicting damage and fracture in metals when overall quantities, like maximum load and dissipated energy, are of interest. The now well-established GTN model is based on the original yield surface by Gurson [16] and was subsequently modified by Tvergaard and Needleman [34,35]. The void growth part of the GTN model is based on the micromechanics of the ductile process. Phenomenological models formulated based on thermodynamical principles have also been proposed such as the Lemaitre model [18] and its subsequent modifications. Among this class of constitutive models, the Rousselier model [31,4] is interesting from a computational perspective as it is simpler and requires the specification of fewer parameters than the GTN model, while possessing the ability to closely match the predictions of the latter by determination of its parameters. It adheres to the idea that the occurrence of localization, crack initiation and propagation emerges as a direct consequence of strain softening due to void growth. Hence, unlike micro-mechanics models of porous metal plasticity, the Rousselier model does not directly model the mechanism of coalescence. However, two properties are worth mentioning:
                        
                           1.
                           The Rousselier model predicts void fraction growth in pure shear.

The Rousselier yield surface has an isochoric vertex causing a non-zero plastic volumetric term component.

The GTN model uses the same coalescence approach as the classical Tvergaard–Needleman technique (cf. [35]).

Both void fraction and damage variables are integrated in closed-form using the Lambert W and the ERF functions.

Due to their complementarity form (see, e.g. [20]), finite strain plasticity problems often exhibit convergence difficulties for large strain values and severe sensitivity to step size [3]. We have two measures to attenuate these difficulties: the use of a smoothed complementarity condition and the removal of iterative rotation matrices from the constitutive laws in finite strains.

It is computationally convenient that both hyperelastic and finite-strain elasto-plastic laws are implemented in a unique algorithm and applicable to any discretization scheme.

Classical assumed-strain elements typically do not directly provide the deformation gradient (e.g. [9]), necessary for many constitutive formulations. An estimated deformation gradient can be calculated from the polar decomposition if an approximate rotation matrix is available. Since a constitutive frame is adopted, the rotation matrix is obtained from this frame in two distinct configurations. Compatible frames use Löwdin׳s method [19].

Since the seminal contributions of Weber and Anand [36] and Simo [32], Kirchhoff stress tensors (i.e. 
                                 τ
                                 =
                                 J
                                 σ
                              ) are frequently employed in the yield functions. This is a computational convenience, as commonly adopted elasto-plastic and hyperelastic models are often quasi-incompressible. This is not the case of porous plasticity (cf. [4]). We therefore avoid that approach.

Semi-implicit formulations, where certain quantities are fixed in the flow vector (but not the flow vector itself), cf. [23,8] can lead to substantial savings in constitutive integration. We further extend the semi-implicit algorithm presented in [3] to achieve very large time steps. Consistent linearization of integrated form of objective rates is intricate and computationally expensive, making it a possible candidate for the explicit integration part of the semi-implicit scheme. However, rigid body motions are exactly accounted for.

Cauchy equations of equilibrium for a rotated reference configuration are obtained from the corresponding spatial equilibrium (derivations for the latter are shown in Ogden [27]). Using standard notation (cf. [27]) we write the spatial equilibrium equations as

The motivation for a unique treatment for all yield functions is that any particular yield function is inserted by means of ϕ, 
                           n
                         and derivatives of 
                           n
                        . This is accomplished with Mathematica and the AceGen add-on [29,17].

With the objective of uniquely defining the element frame compatible with the concept of polar decomposition, use is made of the symmetric orthogonalization formula by Per-Olov Löwdin (cf. [19]). With that purpose, we resort to the singular value decomposition (SVD). Given a real 3×3 matrix 
                           J
                        , there exists a decomposition with the form

                           S
                        . The effect of increasing f can be observed. Void fraction follows from volume change and is calculated exactly as in the previous section. Fracture value f

It can be observed that D indirectly controls the void fraction rate. We can force the growth near the critical value of void fraction to model coalescence as in the GTN model, but with a slight difference (see [35]):

                         we test the two porous plasticity models, along with the classical von-Mises yield criterion. Properties are shown in Table 1
                         for the two presented models. Von-Mises is a particularization.

Isoerror maps are shown in Fig. 4
                         for the three yield functions. We use the properties shown in Table 2
                         for the runs of the isoerror maps. Plane strain condition is assumed (4 direct stress components and 1 shear stress component). For each strain increment a single step is used. The following two conclusions are drawn:
                           
                              •
                              Very small integration errors are observed for the von-Mises yield function. This is well known since in a simpler case an exact solution exists.

The Rousselier yield function exhibits a larger error than the GTN yield function. This is now relatively well known since this yield function is not smooth for all stress states. It is also acknowledgedly difficult to integrate (cf. [4]).

To estimate the properties for the Rousselier model from known properties of the GTN model, we can obtain D, σ

Quasi-incompressible constitutive laws severely reduce the performance of displacement-based elements. Usually, mixed elements are a solution for avoiding locking in quasi-incompressible problems. The low-order MINI element by Arnold [5], see also Bathe [7] and Cao [11], is based on a two-field formulation where:
                           
                              •
                              Pressure is linearly interpolated using the corner nodes.

An internal shape function, named a bubble, enriches the velocity or displacement fields.

We can therefore write

Dimensional reduction for plane-strain requires careful consideration of out-of-plane stress, which is in general non-null. We therefore explicitly enforce the plane-strain condition by setting 13 and 23 components of both stress and strain as zero, but including the out-of-plane stress

                         as active. Therefore, for plane strain, we only omit out-of-plane shear components of stress and strain. In the axisymmetric case, we use reduced integration, which is sufficient to remove locking in the near-incompressible case.

All examples are run in the SIMPLAS framework, cf. [1] with the present formulations. MINI elements were implemented to comply with the Löwdin frames and the relative Green–Lagrange strains. Internal degrees-of-freedom of mixed elements are condensed out.

An axisymmetric idealization of a simple tension test with smooth geometry (cf. [6] for a complete testing program) is made, with the relevant dimensions shown in Fig. 5
                        . The corresponding properties are shown in Table 1. Also shown in Fig. 5 are the contour plots for the effective plastic strain and void fraction in both models. Rousselier yield function produces earlier failure due to a steeper void fraction growth in the early nucleation stages. We can observe that no hourglass or mesh instabilities are visible and contour plots are relatively smooth.

We compare the void fraction evolution for the two models, separating the nucleation and void growth terms, in Fig. 6
                        . It can be observed that the growth term in Rousselier model

                           4
                           Note that properties have been fitted so that intersections in p- and q-axes for both models coincide at

                                 =

                         is much quicker to develop and tends to localize strain in a sharper form (see also Fig. 5).

Evolution of void fraction and effective plastic strain for the GTN yield function is shown in Fig. 7
                        . Reaction–displacement results are also shown in the same figure. We obtain two conclusions:
                           
                              •
                              Effective plastic strain and void fraction evolution are close (however not perfectly close in the case of the effective plastic strain) to the ones reported by Malcher et al. [21]. Reaction–displacement results are very similar to the reported experimental curve (cf. [21])

Some mesh sensitivity is observed, however it can be considered mild and acceptable.

This test, introduced by Bai and Wierzbicki [6] is required to assess the performance in shear of both yield functions. A description of this test is shown in Fig. 9
                         with the corresponding geometrical data. Both [21,22] perform extensive testing with this test to calibrate the constitutive properties. In this work, and for this test, Aluminum 2024-T351 is used and both mesh size and time step size sensitivities are inspected.

For the coarse mesh (due to size constraints), we show a sequence of relevant contour plots in Fig. 10
                        . Since the MINI mixed element technology is employed, severe deformations are possible without volumetric locking. In addition, we note that a shear band is formed at the specimen weak region. Effect of step size is shown in Fig. 11
                         for the GTN model and in Fig. 12
                         for the Rousselier model. Only mild dependence on step size is observed. A complete depiction of the dependence on mesh size is shown in Fig. 13
                         where again only slight dependence is observed. We note that, if stronger localization is required, then the mesh size has a serious effect in the results and regularization will be required. Mesh size effect on the effective plastic strain and void fraction evolution at the monitored node are shown in Fig. 14
                        . In this case some effect is noted, which is not sufficient to detract from the overall very robust results.

To inspect the mesh dependence with full localization (until collapse), we use the geometry from Norris tension test [26] (see also [32]). Fig. 15
                         shows the tension test specimen with effective plastic strain and void fraction contour plots. Two meshes are used: a coarse one with 3175 nodes and a finer one with 5409 nodes (the latter is used in the contour plots). A fixed displacement step of

                         is adopted for this problem. We use the constitutive properties described in Table 4
                         which produce full localization. Regularization is performed by introducing a length-scale l

We presented a general semi-implicit constitutive algorithm and specialized it for the integration of porous plasticity yield functions. New contributions and distinctive features of the proposed algorithm are:
                        
                           •
                           The combination of relative Green–Lagrange strains with the exact corotational method. Quadratic strains are used during iteration whereas a local frame is updated after convergence of Newton iteration.

The use of Löwdin algorithm to calculate orthogonal frames based on the Jacobians of configurations Ω
                              
                                 b
                               and Ω
                              
                                 a
                              . This corresponds to a definition of orthogonal frames consistent with the polar decomposition.

The use of a local constitutive system which is smooth and nonlinear. This is achieved in two steps by replacing the complementarity condition for a non-smooth equation and subsequently by the Chen–Mangasarian replacement function (cf. [13,14]). Local Newton iteration is performed without concerns with the complementarity condition.

The GTN and Rousselier constitutive models are explored in detail, with the determination of intersections with axes of pressure–shear diagram (
                                 p
                                 –
                                 q
                              ). We include isoerror maps and the explicit determination of the void fraction in both models.

The use of finite strain versions of the MINI element (cf. [5]) in triangles and tetrahedra to avoid locking due to quasi-incompressibility in the early stages of void fraction evolution. Specializations and the second variation of the variational principle, required to calculate the stiffness matrix.

The use of a length-scale in the stress measures and effective plastic strain present in the void growth laws, which was found to be sufficient to produce mesh-insensitive results. This is shown in the 3D tension test, where both models were tested with two meshes.
