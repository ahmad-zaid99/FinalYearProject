                  In this paper, an Uzawa-type augmented Lagrangian contact formulation is presented for modeling frictional discontinuities in the framework of the X-FEM technique. The kinematically nonlinear contact problem is resolved based on an active set strategy to fulfill the Kuhn–Tucker inequalities in the normal direction of contact. The Coulomb’s friction rule is employed to address the stick–slip behavior on the contact interface through a return mapping algorithm in conjunction with a symmetrized (nested) augmented Lagrangian approach. A stabilization algorithm is proposed for the robust imposition of the frictional contact constraints within the proposed augmented Lagrangian framework. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate various aspects of the proposed computational algorithm in simulation of the straight, curved and wave-shaped discontinuities.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Numerical simulation of frictional contact behavior between two bodies has enormous applications in broad range of engineering areas. For instance, in the forming process relative movement between the tools and material produces normal and tangential contact forces, which have an important effect on various aspects of the process, such as the pressing forces, density distribution, crack nucleation, and residual stresses [1,2]. Moreover, in geo-mechanical problems the crack growth in compressive zone, such as fault rapture phenomenon, involves frictional sliding of the crack edges [3,4]. The shearing forces on crack faces are determinant in the computation of stress intensity factors, rate of propagation, and direction of propagation; and as a result can drastically affect the behavior of cracked media. Modeling of frictional contact in continuum mechanics produces complexity within the solution, in which two nested Kuhn–Tucker constraints should be satisfied, including: an outer constraint that accounts for the contact/separation mode, and an inner constraint that describes the stick/slip condition on contacting boundaries.

In cases that the contact faces are well defined prior to beginning of the simulation, the finite element method provides a natural means for simulating frictional and frictionless contact problems, see e.g. [5–7]. However, there exist a large variety of applications where the contacting boundaries nucleate in an initially undamaged medium and evolve in an undetermined direction through the simulation, such as mode II and III crack propagation problems. The eXtended Finite Element Method pioneered by Moës et al. [8] circumvents the need for conforming the FE mesh to the evolving boundaries of the discontinuity by enriching the standard FE approximation with additional discontinuous interpolation functions on the basis of the partition of unity method [9,10]. The X-FEM requires no update in the mesh topology, and the only interaction between the FE mesh and the discontinuity involves selection of the nodal points that must be enriched [11,12]. A comprehensive review on X-FEM and its application in a variety of problems in continuum mechanics can be found in [13,14]. In particular, both primal and dual formulations have been pursued to model frictional contact within the context of X-FEM. As a pioneering work, Dolbow et al. [15] employed the LArge Time INcrement (LATIN) method to model frictional contact on embedded interfaces, in which the solution is decomposed into two global (linear) and local (possibly nonlinear) steps, see also [16]. The conventional penalty method has also been employed to model frictional contact problems with the X-FEM in the works of Khoei and Nikbakht [17] and Liu and Borja [18], and is then extended to large sliding-large deformation contact problems [19,20].

It is well recognized that irrespective of whether one employs the penalty method or the Lagrangian approach, imposing the Dirichlet (or stiff Neumann) constraints on embedded interfaces, such as those arising in X-FEM modeling of frictional contact, may cause numerical instability in forms of spurious oscillation in the interfacial traction/flux fields and loss of convergence in local error norms [21–23]. Typically, these oscillations are more severe in the Lagrange multipliers method where contact constraints are imposed exactly, however, the penalty method exhibits the same effect when a high-stiff penalty number is employed to impose the constraints more accurately. In these circumstances, the key challenge is the verification of the so-called Ladyzhenskaya–Babuška–Brezzi condition [24,25], which ensures a proper choice of the discrete space for the Lagrange multipliers in order to avoid an over-constrained solution. Basically, the issue of verifying the LBB (or inf-sup) condition is related to the non-conformity of the X-FEM mesh to the Dirichlet boundaries and stems from the same challenges encountered when dealing with non-conforming Dirichlet boundaries in standard finite element frameworks [26,27]. Ji and Dolbow [21] emphasized that the most convenient choice of basis for the discrete Lagrange multipliers, those that naturally arise from the intersections of the interface with the bulk mesh, triggers oscillation in the Lagrange multipliers field and cause lack of convergence in local error norms.

So far, both stable and stabilized approaches have been adapted to the X-FEM models of contact problems to restore stability of contact stress fields. In general, the discrete Lagrange multipliers space needs to be coarsened with respect to the underlying mesh to recover stable Lagrange multipliers on embedded interfaces. This can be achieved by constructing a stable discrete Lagrange multipliers space based on the vital vertex algorithm proposed by Moës et al. [22] and then improved by Bechet et al. [28] and Hautefeuille et al. [29], or through adopting a mortar-like technique which employs an independent mesh for the discontinuity as proposed by McDevitt and Laursen [30] and Kim et al. [31]. The former approach is also extended for large sliding contact by Nistor et al. [32] and Siavelis et al. [33]. Furthermore, a stable discrete space can be achieved by an additional enrichment of the displacement basis with bubble function as given in [23,34]. On the other hand, the stabilized techniques mostly rely on the Nitsche’s approach adopted to model frictional contact on embedded interfaces in [35–37]. It was shown by Stenberg [38] that the bubble stabilization method is closely related to Nitsche’s approach. There are also a number of stabilized global–local approaches which allow an independent discretization of the bulk and the crack interface, developed in conjunction with the LATIN strategy in non-planar frictional crack and fatigue crack growth [39–41]. A stabilized lower order formulation for frictional contact problems based on the polynomial pressure projection (PPP) method was proposed by Liu and Borja [42] that is applicable to both penalty and Lagrange multipliers methods.

In the present study, an augmented Lagrangian formulation is presented to model frictional discontinuities on the basis of an extended finite element method. The main idea is to combine the penalty and Lagrange multipliers methods to inherit the advantages of both approaches, in order to decrease the ill-conditioning of governing equations and to satisfy the contact constraints more accurately with finite values of penalty parameters. The proposed variational formulation is used to incorporate the frictional contact behavior into the formulation. The finite element equations consist of two sets of equations; a standard FE equation without the discontinuity and an enhanced FE equation that captures the discontinuity and contact contribution via the enriched degrees of freedom. An active set strategy is employed to resolve the kinematically nonlinear equations in conjunction with the Newton–Raphson iterative solution strategy. In order to address the frictional behavior at the contact interface, the plasticity theory of friction is employed based on the Coulomb’s friction law, which is implemented via the standard return mapping algorithm on the basis of a symmetrized (nested) augmented Lagrangian approach. Finally, several numerical examples are simulated to demonstrate various aspects of proposed computational algorithm, including the combined opening–closing and sticking–slipping conditions in frictional straight, curved, and wave-shaped discontinuities.

                      appearing in Eq. (5) accounts for the contribution of the frictional contact condition to the governing variational formulation. Basically, the frictional contact conditions should be imposed on the basis of two nested inequality contact constraints expressed in the form of the Kuhn–Tucker relations. The augmented Lagrangian treatment of the nonlinear frictional contact constraints will be discussed in the following section.

The unilateral contact condition is imposed on the surface of the discontinuity

In this section, an Uzawa-type augmented Lagrange multiplies technique [5–7] is presented to impose the frictional contact constraints defined through relations (6)–(8). Consider two bodies in contact, a master and a slave body, as shown in

                         augmentation. Since relations (12) and (13) utilize a linear update algorithm for the Lagrange multipliers with the slope of the penalty number, a small penalty parameter delays the convergence of the update algorithm. The convergence of solution is, however, independent of the magnitude of the penalty parameter given that strictly positive penalty numbers are employed [7]. It should also be noted that when the convergence to a desired level of accuracy is achieved for the frictional contact constraints, the contact stresses associated with the penalty parameters are null and the Lagrange multipliers represent the actual contact stresses acting on the contact interface. The formulation presented here mimics the so called symmetrized or nested augmented Lagrange multipliers algorithm [5,7], in which the fulfillment of the Coulomb’s friction law is achieved within the outer augmentation loop rather than the inner nonlinear solver iteration.

In order to numerically model the contact friction algorithm described in preceding section, the extended finite element method is employed in which the discontinuity surface is embedded within the finite element mesh by adding appropriate enrichment functions to the standard FE approximation. In this way, the X-FEM approximation of the displacement field is written based on an additive decomposition of the approximation into standard and enriched parts as

                      should be approximated along the contact interface. This is achieved by means of discretization of the contact interface to a set of one-dimensional interface elements, in which the Lagrange multipliers are approximated using their nodal values via appropriate interpolating shape functions [5–7]. Within the context of the X-FEM, the nodal points of the interface elements can be determined by only the geometrical interaction of the discontinuity line and the underlying FE mesh. That is, the nodal points of the interface elements basically lie on the intersections of the discontinuity line with the edges of the finite elements [21,22]. Consider that

                      are the vectors of normal and tangential Lagrange multipliers nodal degrees of freedom, respectively. It should be mentioned that the proper choice of the discrete Lagrange multipliers space should satisfy a uniform inf-sup condition [21] to avoid the non-convergence and spurious oscillations in the local contact stress field. In this study, a technique is proposed for the stabilization of the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM formulation on the basis of the vital vertex algorithm 
                     [22,28,29], which will be presented in Section 4.2.

The discrete form of the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM equations of the frictional contact problem can be obtained by substituting the approximate displacement and strain fields (14) and (18) and the associated variations into the variational Eq. (11), and satisfying the necessity that the weak form should hold for all arbitrary test functions. Hence, the discrete form of the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM equations can be expressed for the

As already pointed out before in Section 3, the formulation presented here is in resemblance with a symmetrized (nested) augmented Lagrangian solution strategy, in which the Coulomb’s friction law is enforced throughout the augmentation loop rather than the inner Newton–Raphson iteration. The symmetrized augmented Lagrange multipliers algorithm with an outer augmentation and inner Newton loop is presented in 
                        Box 1. As can be observed, the augmentation algorithm is used not only to augment the Lagrange multipliers, but also to apply an elastic predictor–plastic corrector return mapping scheme [17,18] to enforce the Coulomb’s law as well. In this way, within the inner solution the stick–slip condition along the contact surface is determined based on the previously-obtained estimation of the normal and tangential contact stresses

                        , which are taken fixed within the Newton–Raphson solution. This approach circumvents the need for linearization of the return mapping algorithm within the Newton iteration, and leads to a symmetric tangent stiffness matrix 
                           K
                        , offering significant advantages from computational point of view.

An important task in the algorithm shown in Box 1 is the determination of active contact surface 
                           
                              Γ
                              d
                              cont
                           
                        . To this end, the whole discontinuity 
                           
                              
                                 Γ
                              
                              
                                 d
                              
                           
                         is first discretized to a mesh of interface elements. Throughout the solution, the active contact surface is defined as the set of interface nodal points whose normal contact stress 
                           
                              
                                 t
                              
                              
                                 N
                              
                           
                         is negative. The remaining nodal points of the interface are in opening mode and thus, their normal and tangential nodal Lagrange multipliers are set to zero. Within the outer augmentation solution, the return mapping algorithm can then be applied at each active node to determine, among all, the sticking and slipping subsets 
                           
                              Γ
                              d
                              stick
                           
                         and 
                           
                              Γ
                              d
                              slip
                           
                        . This approach is in resemblance with the so called active set strategy developed in the finite element solution of nonlinear contact mechanics problems [7].

Finally, the convergence of solution can be obtained based on the global and local error criteria. The global error criterion is defined on the basis of residual force vector of the Newton–Raphson iteration in an inner loop of the solution as

The local error criterion is related to the convergence of the augmentation iteration and is expressed based on the imposition of frictional contact constraints as

Basically, each nodal point of the contact interface can be considered as a contact point where the contact constraints are enforced. In such case, the implementation of a naive discretization of the contact interface that is constructed by the intersections of the discontinuity with the underlying FE mesh usually yields to an over-constrained solution, since it encompasses too many vertices for all of them to define the discrete Lagrange multipliers space [21]. An over-constrained formulation may, in turn, result in non-physical spurious oscillations in the contact stresses and lack of convergence in the local fields. In order to achieve a stable contact traction field, the vital vertex algorithm introduced by Moës et al. [22] is employed here to identify, among all vertices emanated from the naive discretization of contact interface, a subset of vital vertices to which the nodal Lagrange multipliers

                         should be assigned. In brief, the vital vertex algorithm determines the vital vertices of a discontinuity based on the following two main criteria:
                           
                              1)
                              Two vital vertices should not belong to the edges of an element connected to a common nodal point;

An element edge on which a non-vital vertex lies should be connected to at least one element edge holding a vital vertex.

In fact, the vital vertex algorithm ensures that an over-constrained formulation is avoided on one hand (criterion 1) and an under-constrained formulation on the other hand (criterion 2). Further details on the algorithmic implementation of the vital vertex algorithm may be found in [29]. 
                        Fig. 3(a) presents a schematic view of a portion of the domain mesh bisected by the discontinuity line together with the selected vital vertices. Without loss of generality of the formulation, it is assumed that the interface elements are defined by straight lines connecting two adjacent vital vertices, so a piecewise linear approximation is employed for the Lagrange multipliers using the standard basis functions

                        . Fig. 3(b) schematically presents the distribution of these basis functions along the contact interface. It is worthwhile mentioning that in three-dimensional case, computation of the shape functions of multipliers with this approach requires re-construction of the interface mesh using the selected vital vertices, which introduces additional complexities in the problem. For information on an alternative approach to construction of the Lagrange multipliers basis functions for more complex surfaces and three-dimensional problems, the reader is referred to [28,29].

Furthermore, it must be noted that a proper quadrature choice for the numerical integration along contact interfaces is of crucial importance to achieve a stable contact stress field within the proposed augmented Lagrangian framework. As can be seen from Fig. 3(a), the vital vertex algorithm somehow coarsens the interface elements with respect to the interface segments delimited between the edges of the finite elements. In this manner, it is possible that an interface element encompasses several interface segments each of which belonging to different finite elements of the underlying FE mesh. Thus, a proper integration rule of the Lagrange multipliers field along the contact interface is necessary to obtain adequate integration points along each interface segment, since the vector of augmented Lagrangian contact forces

                         contributes to different global degrees of freedom along each segment of an interface element. In this study, a two-point Gauss quadrature is employed along each interface segment to numerically integrate

                        . On the other hand, the numerical integration of penalization contributions

                         should be necessarily performed using a Trapezoidal rule with the integration points located at the nodal points of the interface elements. Indeed, the Trapezoidal rule ensures that the integration points coincide with the vital vertices of the interface where the contact constraints should be enforced. In this manner, the Trapezoidal integration rule can properly resolve the problem of an over-constrained system of equations within the inner solution of the proposed augmented Lagrangian formulation.

In order to illustrate the accuracy and versatility of the proposed computational algorithm, several numerical examples are presented here in modeling frictional contact behavior of straight, curved and wave-shaped discontinuities. The numerical results are presented for both structured and unstructured four-noded quadrilateral meshes. For all numerical simulations, it is not persevered that the element edges be aligned with the contact interface. All problems are solved in plane-strain condition and the entire loading is applied in one computational step. In addition, the infinitesimal deformation is assumed, and the contact behavior is evaluated at the initial configuration of the body. The material behavior is considered to be linearly elastic with the Young modulus of

                         is imposed at the top of the plate while the bottom edge is fixed, such that the interface is in direct contact condition, as shown in 
                        Fig. 4. This simple example is chosen, first, to illustrate the effect of the penalty parameter on the convergence of the Uzawa augmented Lagrangian algorithm and, second, to indicate the efficiency of proposed stabilization technique for a robust imposition of the unilateral contact condition in non-conforming meshes. The numerical simulations are performed using three meshes shown in 
                        Fig. 5. The same problem was also studied previously by Liu and Borja [42] using the Polynomial Pressure Projection (PPP) stabilization technique and by Gravouil et al. [39] using the standard and Non-Locking LATIN (NLLA) methods.

In order to extract the pure effect of normal penalty number on convergence properties of the proposed augmented Lagrangian X-FEM algorithm, the simulations are performed using mesh 1 in which the edges of finite elements are naturally aligned with the horizontal interface. In such condition, the proposed mesh configuration requires no stabilization technique for a robust imposition of the unilateral contact constraint, and eliminates the effect of an unstable Lagrange multipliers space on the convergence of solution.

                           . Note that the inner Newton–Raphson iteration converges in only one iteration since the contact interface is priori known. The results clearly indicate that the convergence of the augmented Lagrange multipliers method can be obtained independent of the penalty number and this parameter only influences the convergence rate of the algorithm. It must be noted that the solution of penalty method can be recovered from the solution of augmented Lagrange multipliers method at the first augmentation where the augmented Lagrange multiplier is zero and the normal contact constraint is enforced only approximately. However, the augmented Lagrange multipliers approach allows to achieve the normal contact constraint at a desired level of accuracy. This is even true when a relatively small penalty number is used, circumventing the difficulties associated with the ill-conditioning of the penalty formulation when a very large penalty number is employed to impose the contact constraint more accurately.

In order to provide a comparative discussion on the presented results, the standard LATIN method [15] is also implemented here. An optimum value for the regularization parameter of the LATIN method 
                              k
                            can be estimated classically using the ratio of the Young modulus to the crack length as

                           Table 2 presents the convergence profiles of the standard LAITN method using the above value of LATIN parameter. In this table, the global and local error indicators are obtained according to relations (25) and (27) through the LATIN iterations. Obviously, the rate of convergence obtained by the standard LATIN method is much slower than that obtained by the augmented Lagrange X-FEM algorithm. To remedy the problem of slow convergence rate of the standard LATIN method, Gravouil et al. [39] proposed the Non-Locking LATIN (NLLA) method. For the same example considered here, they reported a minimum of 40 iterations to achieve the desired level of accuracy, while only a few iterations is required by the augmented Lagrange multipliers algorithm proposed here.

In 
                           Fig. 6, the profile of normal contact stress along the horizontal interface obtained from the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM algorithm is compared with that reported by Liu and Borja [42]. It must be highlighted that the result of LATIN method is also identical to that of the augmented Lagrange multipliers method although it is not shown here for the clarity of presentation. Obviously, the results demonstrate an excellent agreement. Note that the augmented Lagrange multipliers method leads to identical normal contact traction field for all three penalty numbers proposed above, since convergence to machine precision is achieved for the local error criterion for all three penalty numbers.

In order to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed stabilized augmented Lagrangian X-FEM algorithm, the problem is solved once again using meshes 2 and 3 shown in Fig. 5, where two unstructured FE meshes are employed. In this way, the edges of elements are not necessarily aligned with the contact interface passing through an arbitrary path within the elements. Before proceeding with illustration of the performance of stabilization strategy, the contours of vertical displacement obtained from mesh 3 using the stabilized and unstabilized algorithms are shown in 
                           Fig. 7. Obviously, the displacement contours show almost identical results. These typical results clearly demonstrate that a naive discretization of the contact interface does not necessarily disturb the overall deformation of the plate; however, it will trigger spurious oscillations in the local contact stress field, as discussed below.

In 
                           Fig. 8, the profiles of normal contact stress are plotted along the horizontal interface for meshes 2 and 3 using the stabilized and unstabilized (naive discretization of the contact interface) strategies. A comparison is also performed with that obtained from the structured mesh 1. Obviously, a smooth contact stress field can be obtained for both meshes 2 and 3 when the stabilization strategy is applied. Note that the slight oscillations observed in the profiles of contact stress may be attributed to the uneven discretization of contact interface, and can be removed by refining the FE mesh. It can be clearly observed that the unstabilized algorithm with a naive discretization results in drastic oscillations in the contact stress field. Moreover, it is obvious that the trends of oscillations change with different mesh configurations; as a result, it can be highlighted that the oscillations emanate from the numerical instability rather than the physical response of the structure. For all cases, the numerical simulations are performed using the penalty number of

                            for both meshes 2 and 3 when the proposed stabilized strategy is employed.

Finally, the profiles of contact stress along the horizontal interface are plotted in 
                           Fig. 9 for two meshes 2 and 3 using different numerical integration schemes. Consistent with the argument made in Section 4.2, it is obvious that the numerical integration of penalization contributions of the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM formulation based on the two-point Gauss quadrature leads to an unstable contact stress field for both meshes 2 and 3 notwithstanding the adequate integration of the Lagrangian contributions. Similarly, the Trapezoidal rule is inadequate to precisely integrate the Lagrangian contributions of the formulation, and adversely affects the smooth profile of the contact stress field.

The next example is chosen to illustrate the performance of proposed augmented Lagrangian X-FEM technique for modeling the straight interface with frictional stick–slip behavior considering three case studies of frictional contact behavior.

Obviously, the results indicate a great agreement with those reported in [37]. Note that the structured mesh 1 requires no stabilization strategy to achieve a stable contact stress field since the element edges are aligned with the contact interface. However, the results of meshes 2 and 3 clearly indicate that the convergence is achieved in both normal and tangential directions notwithstanding the non-conformity of unstructured meshes to the contact interface. It must be noted that for the value of frictional coefficient

                            considered here, the frictional contact forces readily reach the slip limit along the entire length of the interface, so the contact interface is in slipping condition.

The robustness of proposed augmented Lagrangian X-FEM algorithm is further illustrated in modeling of the mixed stick–slip condition along the contact interface when the frictional coefficient of

                           . However, two distinct regions of stick and slip behavior can be obviously distinguished according to results presented in Fig. 14. In the stick region, where the tangential contact stresses drop below the slip limit, no relative displacement occurs between the contacting boundaries, as shown in Fig. 14(a). As can be seen from the sticking region of Fig. 14(b), the frictional forces eventually reach the slip limit where the transition from sticking to slipping occurs. In the slipping region, the relative movement is allowed and the frictional stresses are obtained according to the Coulomb’s friction law between the contacting boundaries.

                           Fig. 15. The plate is

                           . Due to the vertical displacement applied at the top edge, the crack faces may undergo relative tangential movement; however, it is assumed that the crack tips cannot propagate. This example is originally modeled by Dolbow et al. [15] and then simulated by Liu and Borja [18] using the standard penalty method.


                           
                           Fig. 16 displays the deformed configuration of the X-FEM mesh. Obviously, there is a tangential relative movement along the crack interface. In 
                           Fig. 17, the contours of horizontal and vertical displacement fields are shown at the final stage of loading, which can be compared with those reported by Liu and Borja [18]. It should be mentioned that the numerical simulations are performed using the penalty numbers

                           . In this way, the accuracy of machine precision was obtained for the local error criterion within only five augmentations, as opposed to the LATIN method which required in excess of one hundred iterations to achieve the desired level of accuracy [15]. The superiority of proposed computational algorithm comes forth on noting that the penalty method enforces the contact constraints only approximately while it requires nearly the same number of total iterations [18] with that required by the augmented Lagrange multiplies method. Note that since the Return mapping algorithm of the Coulomb’s rule is performed through the outer augmentation iterations, the inner solution phase is linear given the priori known contact surface and the Newton–Raphson iteration converges to machine precision in only one iteration within each augmentation loop.

The last example is chosen to demonstrate the performance of proposed computational algorithm for a challenging problem, where a rectangular block with a wave-shaped frictional interface is modeled under shear loading, as shown in 
                        Fig. 18. The wavy discontinuities in geological problems, such as natural joints, faults, flaws and bedding planes, are generally subjected to frictional contact condition. An appropriate modeling of such frictional discontinuities is of great importance in computational geosciences in order to efficiently assess the behavior of the cracked media [3,4]. In this example, a wave-shaped frictional interface embedded in a rectangular block of 
                           0.2
                           
                           m
                         wide and 
                           0.1
                           
                           m
                         high is modeled under pure shear loading by applying a horizontal displacement of 
                           3
                           
                           mm
                         at the top edge while the bottom edge is fixed. The wave-shaped interface has a frictional behavior with the friction coefficient of 
                           μ
                           =
                           0.25
                        , and is characterized by a B-spline passing through the middle of the block with an amplitude of 
                           0.01
                           
                           m
                        .

The problem is modeled using three X-FEM meshes, as shown in 
                        Fig. 19. In mesh 1, the edges of the elements through which the interface passes are intentionally aligned with the interface, which is called as the ‘aligned’ mesh. Because of the conformity of the ‘aligned’ mesh to the contact interface, no stabilization technique is required for this mesh to achieve a smooth contact stress field; that is, all the interface vertices are vital. However, meshes 2 and 3 consist of structured finite elements in which the contact interface passes through an arbitrary path within the elements, which are referred to mesh 2 as an ‘unaligned’ coarse mesh and to mesh 3 as an ‘unaligned’ fine mesh. In these ‘unaligned’ meshes, the wavy contact interface is defined by the straight line segments connecting two adjacent vital vertices of the interface. In all cases, the finite elements are refined in a vicinity of the interface path in order to achieve a smoother discretization of the curved contact surface. Nonetheless, the discretization of the curved interface results in a jump in the normal direction to the interface at each nodal point of the interface. Hence, the normal vector 
                           n
                         is regularized at each nodal point of the interface as

                         is obtained within a maximum of seven augmentations for all meshes. Although the contact interface is not priori known, the profiles of Newton iterations plotted in 
                        Fig. 20 exhibit the asymptotic rate of quadratic convergence of the Newton method, such that the convergence is achieved in only four iterations for all X-FEM meshes. Note that the Newton algorithm converges in even less iterations within the subsequent augmentations since the contact surface obtained from the first augmentation makes the initial estimation of the contact surface quite close to the final solution. In 
                        Fig. 21, the evolutions of normal opening displacement along the contact interface are plotted for three X-FEM meshes. As can be seen from this figure, the opening modes with traction free surfaces appear in roughly one-quarter of contact interface at the left and right regions, while the remaining zone at the middle of the interface is in direct frictional contact condition. Obviously, the normal opening displacement of the interface is nearly insensitive to the mesh refinement. Moreover, the results obtained by the ‘aligned’ and ‘unaligned’ X-FEM meshes are in great agreement, indicative of the robustness of proposed stabilized augmented Lagrange multipliers algorithm in modeling of curved contacting boundaries. In 
                        Fig. 22, the contours of horizontal and vertical displacement are shown on the deformed configuration of the block for the ‘aligned’ X-FEM mesh, where an anti-symmetric response can be observed with respect to the contact interface.

                        , as considered for the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM technique. The integration of contact forces in the standard penalty method is performed using a two point Gauss quadrature rule for each interface element. Note that because of the conformity of the ‘aligned’ mesh to the interface, no special treatment is required in this mesh to achieve a stable contact stress field. However, the standard penalty X-FEM method results in severe oscillations in the normal contact stress field for the ‘aligned’ mesh (mesh 1), which is in opposition to the results reported in Fig. 23(b) using the augmented Lagrangian X-FEM technique for the ‘aligned’ and ‘unaligned’ X-FEM meshes. Indeed, the oscillations observed in Fig. 23(a) are mostly associated with the jump in normal direction to the curved interface at the interface nodal points. In this manner, the smooth contact stress profiles shown in Fig. 23(b) clearly indicate the robustness of the proposed augmented Lagrangian contact algorithm in X-FEM modeling of curved interfaces. It must also be noted that the slight oscillations observed in the contact stress field obtained from the augmented Lagrange multipliers method with the ‘unaligned’ meshes should not be considered as a major drawback since they do not affect the accuracy and convergence of the solution. Indeed, these oscillations emanate from the jump in normal direction to the interface and can be alleviated by refining the mesh, as can also be seen in Fig. 23(b).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In the present paper, a frictional contact algorithm was presented based on the Uzawa-type augmented Lagrange multipliers technique in the framework of the extended finite element method. The frictional contact forces were decomposed into the penalization and Lagrangian parts and expressed in terms of internal nodal forces through the Heaviside enrichment degrees of freedom. An algorithm of the so called active set strategy was employed through an iterative Newton–Raphson procedure to resolve the nonlinear contact problem associated with inequalities of the Kuhn–Tucker relations. The Coulomb’s friction law was employed to address the frictional contact behavior, which was resolved on the basis of a return mapping algorithm in conjunction with a symmetrized augmented Lagrange multipliers approach. Moreover, a stabilization strategy was proposed on the basis of a vital vertex algorithm for the robust imposition of frictional contact constraints within the framework of augmented Lagrange multipliers method.

Finally, several examples were solved numerically to demonstrate various aspects of the proposed computational algorithm in simulation of the straight, curved and wave-shaped discontinuities. In the first example, an elastic square plate with a horizontal interface at its center was considered to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed augmented Lagrangian X-FEM technique in two cases; first, the effect of normal penalty parameter was studied on the convergence rate of unilateral contact constraints, and then the performance of proposed stabilization technique was examined in non-conforming meshes in which the contact interface is not necessarily aligned with the element edges. The second example was devoted to illustrate the robustness of proposed augmented Lagrange multipliers method in modeling the frictional stick–slip behavior, where a variety of frictional behavior including the mixed stick–slip condition was modeled. Finally, the last example was chosen to demonstrate the performance of proposed computational algorithm in a challenging problem, where a rectangular block with a wave-shaped frictional contact interface was modeled under shear loading. It was shown that the proposed augmented Lagrange X-FEM method can be efficiently used to achieve a smooth contact stress field even if the element edges are not aligned with the curved/wavy interface. Furthermore, the quadratic convergence rate of the Newton iterations was achieved for the global solution to model the mixed opening–closing mode along the frictional discontinuity. The superiority of proposed computational model over the penalty method was obviously demonstrated in this example. The numerical results clearly illustrate that the proposed augmented Lagrangian X-FEM algorithm can be used efficiently as a robust technique for tackling complex contact problems including mixed-mode crack propagation problems with frictional contact conditions along the propagating crack faces.
