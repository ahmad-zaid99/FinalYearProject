                  We argue that a hexagonal grid with simple intermediate nodes is a robust alternative to buffered clock trees typically used for clock distribution in VLSI circuits, multi-core processors, and other applications that require accurate synchronization: Our HEX grid is Byzantine fault-tolerant, self-stabilizing, and seamlessly integrates with multiple synchronized clock sources, as used in multi-synchronous Globally Synchronous Locally Asynchronous (GALS) architectures. Moreover, HEX guarantees a small clock skew between neighbors even for wire delays that are only moderately balanced. We provide both a theoretical analysis of the worst-case skew and simulation results that demonstrate a very small average skew.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Being able to distribute a synchronized clock signal to a large number of spatially distributed functional units is crucial for the synchronous design paradigm. In Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits, multi-core processors, and other hardware devices (as well as in master-slave-type network clock synchronization approaches like IEEE1588 [1]), this is accomplished by means of a clock tree, which distributes the clock signal supplied by a single clock source to all functional units attached as leaf nodes. Topologies that guarantee equal wire lengths from the root to the leaves are used to ensure that clock pulses arrive at all functional units (i.e., those making up a synchronous sub-system) simultaneously. Such topologies are, for example, H-trees,
                        3
                     
                     
                        3
                        H-trees are recursively constructed from a H-shaped wiring topology by attaching four smaller H-shapes to the four open ends.
                      combined with carefully engineered wire geometries, clock signal regeneration buffers, etc. This must be achieved with a clock skew, i.e., maximum difference of the occurrence real-times of corresponding clock pulses at different functional units, well below half the clock cycle time: When a functional unit sends some data, say, on local clock count 1000, the receiver is expected to receive and process the data when clock 1001 occurs according to its clock count.

Clock trees are attractive for several reasons. Besides conceptual simplicity, their height is only logarithmic in the number of the leaves (which is proportional to the die area), and the number of internal clock wires is linear in this number. As trees are planar graphs, it would (in principle) even be possible to route these links on a single interconnect layer.

These advantages come at a price, though: Elaborate clock tree engineering must ensure that the maximum delay discrepancy remains below the acceptable clock skew, which is very difficult for clock speeds in the GHz range [2–5]. Modern clock trees thus incorporate complex wire geometries and strong clock buffers, implying large area and power consumption [6]. Moreover, mitigating the inevitable skews from disjoint root-leaf paths requires extended topologies, such as trees with cross-links, meshes and multi-level trees [5,7].

An even more serious issue with clock trees is lacking robustness, which also arises in applications where there are no severe skew requirements. First of all, at the top level, a single clock source obviously constitutes a single point of failure. This is avoided by Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) [8] architectures, where different parts of a chip are clocked by different clock sources and clock trees. However, using independent and hence unsynchronized clock domains gives away the advantages of global synchrony and thus requires non-synchronous cross-domain communication mechanisms or synchronizers [9–12]. Multi-synchronous clocking [13,14] (also called mesochronous clocking [15]), which guarantees some upper bound on the skew between clock domains, has been invented to avoid this. The resulting architectures can rely on a common time base, which is attractive not only for application programmers, but also for metastability-free high-speed communication between different clock domains [16].

Still, the problem of limited robustness of clock trees persists even in GALS architectures: If just one internal wire or clock buffer in a clock tree breaks, e.g., due to some manufacturing defect or breakdown [17], all the functional units supplied via the affected subtree will stop working correctly. Therefore, it is desirable to have fairly small clock trees in a GALS system, necessitating a large number of synchronized clock domains. Overcoming the fundamental scalability and robustness issues of clock trees hence introduces the new challenge of robustly establishing tight synchronization among a large number of clock domains.


                     Contribution
                  

In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing an alternative way for distributing a synchronized clock signal throughout an integrated circuit. Our approach, termed HEX, is based on a sufficiently connected wiring topology, namely, a hexagonal grid.
                        4
                     
                     
                        4
                        Note that clock distribution by means of our HEX grid is fundamentally different from using a clock mesh [5] for averaging out large clock skews among nearby leaf nodes.
                      At each grid point, we place an (intermediate) node that controls when the clock pulses are forwarded to adjacent nodes and supplies the clock to nearby functional units, typically using a small local clock tree. It will turn out that HEX compares favorably to clock trees in most aspects.

In particular, with respect to robustness, our approach supports multiple synchronized clock sources, and tolerates Byzantine failures of both clock sources and nodes. Its resilience to failures scales with the size of the grid, in the sense that it supports a constant density of isolated Byzantine nodes, and it can handle a larger number of more benign failures like broken wires, or mute clock sources and nodes. It is self-stabilizing [18], in the sense that it recovers from an arbitrary number of transient faults, despite persisting isolated Byzantine failures.

Furthermore, HEX has enticing properties with respect to the achievable skew between neighbors in the grid, which are typically the ones who need to communicate synchronously with each other. First, wires between HEX nodes are much shorter than in a clock tree: Assuming a constant spatial node density, the total number of nodes 
                        n
                        =
                        Θ
                        (
                        
                           
                              s
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        )
                      is proportional to the square of the width and height s of a quadratic grid.

As 
                        s
                        =
                        Θ
                        (
                        
                           n
                        
                        )
                     , the wire length between neighbors in HEX is, with optimal layout (cf. Section 5), only 
                        Θ
                        (
                        1
                        )
                     . By contrast, the height of a clock tree is 
                        Θ
                        (
                        log
                        ⁡
                        n
                        )
                      thus, even with optimal layout, their will be neighbors which are separated by a wire length of 
                        Ω
                        (
                        
                           n
                        
                        )
                     . HEX hence neither requires strong clock buffers nor special wire geometries, so that the maximal difference ε of the end-to-end delays between neighbors in the grid could easily be kept small even by moderate engineering efforts.

Second, for a proper embedding of the HEX topology, physically close nodes are reasonably well-synchronized. It is well-known, e.g., from [19], that no deterministic clock synchronization algorithm can guarantee a worst-case skew between all pairs of nodes that is better than 
                        D
                        ε
                        /
                        2
                     , where D is the diameter of the underlying communication graph. Moreover, the gradient clock synchronization lower bounds established in [20] reveal that the skew between neighbors cannot be better than 
                        Ω
                        (
                        ε
                        log
                        ⁡
                        D
                        )
                     . We will show that the neighbor skew provided by HEX is at most 
                        O
                        (
                        D
                        
                           
                              ε
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                        )
                     , where D is in fact the width of the grid. Depending on the number and severity of faults, this skew bound gracefully degrades.

After a short description of related work, the HEX topology and algorithm as well as the system model are introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, we provide a detailed analysis of the worst-case neighbor skew of HEX (Section 3.1), discuss the effect of faulty nodes on the skew (Section 3.2), and analyze the self-stabilizing properties of HEX (Section 3.3). As the complexity of the skew analysis explodes for an increasing number of faults, the detailed analysis in the case of a single Byzantine faulty node is provided in Appendix A. In Section 4, we provide the corresponding results of our extensive simulation experiments, which have been obtained via a custom Modelsim-based simulation and analysis framework. In Section 5, we discuss practical extensions of HEX, in particular, frequency multiplication and alternative grid topologies. Some conclusions and directions of future work in Section 6 complete the paper. A glossary of the notations used can be found on the last page of this paper.

Apart from the rich literature on clock tree engineering and extended topologies for skew reduction, see for example [2–7,17,21,22], we are not aware of much research on alternative clock distribution techniques. An exception is the work on distributed clock generation without local oscillators, which inherently also solves the problem of clock distribution. These approaches are essentially based on (distributed) ring oscillators, which are formed by gates arranged in a feedback loop. In [23], a regular structure of closed loops of an odd number of inverters is used for distributed clock generation. Similarly, [24,25] employ local pulse generation cells, arranged in a two-dimensional grid, with each cell inverting its output signal when its four inputs (from the up, down, left, and right neighbor) match the current clock output value. A more elaborate approach along the same lines uses an array of PLLs that are mutually synchronized among each other, using digital feedback exchanged across some (sparse) communication topology, like a grid [26–28]. To the best of our knowledge, none of these approaches has been analyzed for its fault-tolerance properties, not to speak of self-stabilization.

The only fault-tolerant clock generation approaches for multi-synchronous GALS systems known to us are the Byzantine fault-tolerant DARTS approach [29,30] and our self-stabilizing Byzantine fault-tolerant FATAL algorithm proposed in [31]. However, both approaches are complex and require a fully connected topology. Consequently, they are not useful for distributing a synchronized clock to a large number of functional units, but are rather suitable candidates for the clock sources required by our HEX grid.

We consider a set of nodes executing a pulse generation and forwarding algorithm, which communicate by message passing over a communication network whose underlying undirected communication graph is a cylindric hexagonal grid.

Each node of the grid runs an algorithm that can broadcast trigger messages (representing clock pulses) over its outgoing links, as well as receive trigger messages over its incoming links. Each fault-free link guarantees a communication delay (i.e., the time between sending and receiving a trigger message) within

                     . Having ε without any constraint, however, could render a few worst-case constructions (based on Definition 2) overly conservative. This can be avoided by the additional constraint

                        2
                     , which guarantees a property similar to the triangle inequality. Each node further has access to a (possibly inaccurate) clock to measure timeouts.

Nodes at layer 0 are special as they act as primary clock sources, i.e., they execute a pulse generation algorithm like the one of [30,31] that generates synchronized and well-separated consecutive initial trigger messages. For each pulse number

                      trigger message is sufficiently large. The precise meaning of “sufficiently large” depends on the desired fault-tolerance properties; we will elaborate on this in Section 3.3. Note that it is desirable to keep the maximal time between pulses small in order to guarantee a high operating frequency.

Nodes at layers larger than 0 run the HEX pulse forwarding algorithm specified in Algorithm 1
                     . Basically, nodes forward pulse k once they received trigger messages for pulse k from two adjacent neighbors. Since clock pulses and trigger messages carry no information beside their occurrence, care must be taken in order not to generate multiple trigger messages for a single pulse. The simple solution we use here relies on a sufficiently large separation between the

In this section, we analyze skew and fault-tolerance properties of the HEX algorithm in the topology presented in the previous section. Recall that nodes in layer 0 generate synchronized pulses, which the nodes in higher layers just propagate upwards; this results in a “pulse wave” as depicted in Fig. 8.

                         assuming that the constraints (C1) and (C2) below are satisfied and no nodes are faulty. In a nutshell, our constraints ensure that, initially, all nodes have cleared their memory flags and are waiting for the next pulse generated by the nodes in layer 0.

                                  is sufficiently large so that no trigger message from a neighbor is “forgotten” before the corresponding message from another neighbor arrives. Thus we can be sure that a node which is not sleeping will be triggered by a wave.

We first introduce the concept of “left zig-zag paths”, which will play an essential role in bounding the worst-case triggering times of adjacent nodes in a single pulse wave.

                           Causal links and paths


                           A node is left-triggered/centrally triggered/right-triggered in a given execution, if the satisfied guard from Algorithm 1 causing the node to trigger is having received trigger messages from the left and lower left/lower left and lower right/lower right and right neighbors, respectively. In each case both of the respective links are causal. A causal path consists of causal links only.

Note that a link being causal implies that its endpoint is triggered at least

                                 Our proof also holds for the general case, though, provided (i) one just neglects the fact that some of the index pairs may actually refer to the same node (which does not affect our argument) and that (ii) certain left zig-zag paths in our construction cannot occur (which may lead to an overly conservative bound).
                               Consequently, we only need to consider the set S of nodes in the triangle with corners

                              . Hence, a node p that is h hops from

In the following definition, we will introduce the different notions related to the skew between nodes. Besides the maximum (unsigned) intra-layer skew of neighboring nodes at the same layer and the (signed) maximum inter-layer skew w.r.t. the layer below, we also define the skew potential of layer ℓ. Informally, the latter provides a measure for the adversary's ability to exploit the existing skew of the nodes in layer ℓ to increase the skew of neighboring nodes in layer 
                           ℓ
                           +
                           1
                        . By this, we mean that the adversary can, in the worst case, force a node at layer 
                           ℓ
                           +
                           1
                         to left-trigger strictly before it is centrally triggered by its layer-ℓ neighbors. It is not too difficult to prove

                           In fact, this proof is embedded in the proof of Lemma 4. In a nutshell, it shows that such an early left-triggering would only be possible if the left neighbor itself was early left-triggered as well. By continuing this argument inductively over the entire layer, a left neighbor will eventually be reached that cannot be left-triggered, which provides the required contradiction.
                         that this is only possible if the skew between neighbors at layer ℓ is strictly larger than

                        . Hence, we define the skew potential below in a way that results in a positive value only in the latter case.

We first prove a weak bound on the maximal skew at the upper layers that holds independently of the initial skew potential

                        . Note that this result implies tolerance of HEX against arbitrary layer 0 skews, at the expense of “losing” layers

                              , as claimed.

Finally, since the above proof did not require any specific property to be respected by layer 0 nodes, it also applies literally if we replace layer 
                                 W
                                 −

                                 ℓ
                                 −
                                 W

                              . This concludes the proof of Lemma 3.  □

Next, we derive more refined bounds on the intra-layer skew between two neighboring nodes at the same layer 
                           ℓ
                           >
                           0
                        : In contrast to Lemma 3, we now take the maximal skew in previous layers into account. Unfortunately, its proof is complicated by the fact that we need to distinguish three different cases that might lead to the worst-cast skew

Informally, Case 1 is characterized by a V-shaped growth of the worst-case skew: Our detailed proof will show that

Since the claimed bound holds in each of the (exhaustive) cases considered, the proof of Lemma 4 is completed.  □

We remark that it is possible to construct, by deterministically choosing appropriate link delays, worst-case executions that almost match the bounds established in Lemma 4; an example is shown in Fig. 5
                        .

In the proof of Lemma 4, in particular, in Case 2 (Fig. 4c), we silently assumed that the starting node

                           0

                         on the right side. Whereas this is reasonable for wide grids, this is not realistic if W is small. Considering such a collision prohibits some of the worst-case scenarios considered, and hence possibly makes the worst-case skew result provided by Lemma 4 overly conservative. We therefore provide the following corollary, which takes this width constraint into account.

                               where we used Eq. (4) to derive the second inequality.

Checking the bounds from Case 1 and Case 3 in Lemma 4, we see that they are smaller or equal to the left term in the maximum on the right hand side of the claimed bound. The bound for the differently treated Case 2 matches the right term in the maximum.  □

We are now ready to derive our main result, namely, bounds on the worst-case skews between neighbors.

We now extend the analysis from the fault-free case to the case of some faulty nodes in the grid. We still confine our examination to a single pulse; we will show later that the necessary preconditions for this type of analysis will eventually be satisfied, no matter what the initial states of the nodes are.

Since the communication structure of our algorithm is extremely simple, it is not difficult to understand the “options” of Byzantine nodes for disrupting the system's operation within a single pulse, given that all correct nodes have cleared their memory and await the next pulse. If faulty nodes have the possibility to cause a correct node to generate a “false” pulse (i.e., to trigger without the immediate support of other correct nodes) this will clearly break our protocol: Once this happens, this will cause a chain reaction distributing the false pulse just like a correct one.

A similar problem arises if a correct node 
                           (
                           ℓ
                           ,
                           i
                           )
                         has a second faulty neighbor (even if it is just a crash fault) and the two faults are not the left and right neighbors. If both faulty neighbors omit to send trigger messages, the node is not going to be triggered. However, if a Byzantine neighbor does send a trigger message, at some time after 
                           (
                           ℓ
                           ,
                           i
                           )
                         has received a trigger message from another neighbor, but before the respective link timeout expires, it is immediately triggered. Hence, a Byzantine node can trigger 
                           (
                           ℓ
                           ,
                           i
                           )
                         late in this case, again creating a “false” pulse.

Finally, if both the left and right neighbors of correct nodes may fail, we could have every second node in an entire layer failing, which would prevent the propagation of pulses if these nodes do not send messages. With these issues in mind, we arrive at the following sufficient condition for triggering all nodes exactly once per pulse. 
                           Condition 1
                           Fault separation


                           For each node, no more than one of its incoming links connects to a faulty neighbor.

We use the following definition to summarize skews.

                               has skew at most σ. The skew for layer 0 is given by the used clock generation scheme. If layer L has skew at most σ (i.e., any two correct neighbors have skew at most σ) we say that the pulse has skew at most σ.

If Condition 1 is satisfied and all correct nodes have cleared all memory flags before a pulse arrives, it is straightforward to derive a (fairly coarse) skew bound.

This lemma shows that even in the presence of multiple faults the time to complete a pulse increases only moderately. Thus, increasing the time between pulses (originating from layer 0) accordingly will maintain a clean separation of pulses.

                         is the fault-free layer ℓ intra-layer skew given in Theorem 1, a more detailed reasoning is required to prove such a bound. Unfortunately, the number of cases that needs to be considered in a formal proof explodes quickly. A large number of cases needed to be examined already in the fault-free case, and dealing with just a single fault became sufficiently tedious for being relegated to Appendix A. Informally, the reasoning employs the following arguments: For a Byzantine faulty node, there are only two options for increasing the skew between neighbors: (i) “shortcut” a causal path to the fast node and (ii) refrain from triggering nodes to inhibit the propagation of the pulse to the slow node.

Dealing with (i) is straightforward: If during the construction of a causal path we run into a Byzantine node, we follow the other incoming causal link of the predecessor node instead, thereby avoiding the Byzantine node, and resume the construction. This is particularly simple for the left zig-zag paths used in Cases 2 and 3 of Lemma 4; see Fig. 6
                         for an example of how this might look like, where the faulty node is located at 
                           (
                           ℓ
                           −
                           1
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 j
                              
                              
                                 0
                              
                           
                           )
                        . When dealing with (ii), the situation is similar. Instead of circumventing faulty nodes in the construction of a causal path, we now need to avoid relying on them to trigger correct nodes. Fig. 6 also gives an example for this, for a faulty node at 
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           i
                           +
                           1
                           )
                        . Consult Appendix A for the detailed discussion of these (and similar) cases.

Consequently, in order to increase skews significantly, several faulty nodes need to be in a region that causally affects two neighbors. In a setting where delays are random, it seems unlikely that the elaborate patterns required for large skews will arise, in particular if faults are not in close vicinity of each other. The simulations in Section 4 support this view, showing moderate increase of skews despite a significant number of faults.

We point out that crash failures, where nodes simply cease operating, are more benign. Instead of breaking the entire system, two adjacent crash failures on some layer just effectively crash their common neighbor in the layer above and affect the skews of surrounding nodes. We refer to [32] for simulations concerning crash faults.


                        Self-stabilization is the ability of the system to recover from an unbounded number of transient faults [18], which may put the system into an arbitrarily erroneous state. When transient faults cease, the system will resume normal operation within a bounded stabilization time—ideally even in the presence of a bounded number of persistent faults. In this section, we will show that HEX is self-stabilizing even in the presence of up to f Byzantine faulty nodes that satisfy Condition 1; under the assumption that correct nodes faithfully execute the HEX algorithm, the pulse generation will eventually work as specified in Lemma 5, even when all nodes start from arbitrary internal states. Note that this can also be guaranteed for the pulse generation at layer 0, by using a self-stabilizing and Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm like

In the previous section, we argued that faulty nodes have an adverse, but bounded, effect on the skew and the time to complete a pulse. To ensure self-stabilization, we account for this by some additional slack in the time between the

With this lemma, the proof of Theorem 2 boils down to showing that if layer ℓ is stable in pulse k, then layer

                           Proof of Theorem 2
                           We prove the theorem by induction on ℓ, where the hypothesis is that the claims of the theorem are satisfied by all layers

                              , repeated use of Lemma 6 reveals that it is sufficient to show that layer

To this end, suppose that starting from the above time t, nodes on layer

                               could be triggered due to a remembered message from some correct neighbor on layer ℓ is smaller than 
                                 t

                              .

Hence, consider the case that

                                 i

                               has a faulty neighbor on layer ℓ. W.l.o.g., assume that the faulty neighbor is node

                                 ℓ

                               (the other case is symmetric). By the above reasoning, 
                                 (

As mentioned earlier, the analytic results obtained in the previous sections are limited to worst-case skews. Hence, we conducted extensive simulation experiments to complement them with representative statistical data. This data reveals the following major facts about HEX:
                        
                           (1)
                           
                              Average skews considerably smaller than worst-case. The quite fancy scenarios required for establishing the worst-case skews in Theorem 1 already suggested that they are very unlikely to occur in practice. Indeed, we were not able to generate neighbor skews that came close to the worst case under uniformly and independently distributed link delays.


                              Small, localized fault effects. As argued in Section 3.3, HEX should implicitly confine the effects created by a faulty node to a small neighborhood. Our simulation results revealed that faults typically affect direct neighbors only, and become invisible after one additional hop. This is true even for clustered crash faults and multiple (separated) Byzantine faults.


                              Stabilization times much smaller than guaranteed by theoretical analysis. The layer-wise stabilization used for bounding the worst-case stabilization time in Section 3.3 assumes an involved worst-case scenario on each layer, which appears to be very unlikely in practice. Simulations of the original version [33] of the HEX algorithm already revealed typical stabilization times that are much smaller than the predicted worst case. The link timeouts added in Algorithm 1 cause HEX to reliably stabilize within two clock pulses, even in scenarios with multiple faults.

Our simulation framework has been built around Mentor Graphics® ModelSim 10.1d, which allows accurate digital timing simulations of circuit designs specified in VHDL (Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language). It is used to simulate an entire HEX grid, which consists of multiple instances of a VHDL implementation of Algorithm 1 embedded into a custom testbench. The latter has the following purposes:

Control fault injection during the simulation: links can be declared correct, Byzantine (choose output constant 0 resp. 1 corresponding to no resp. fast triggering), or fail-silent (output constant 0); declaring a node Byzantine or fail-silent is equivalent to doing so for each of its outgoing links. The selection of faulty nodes and/or links can be done deterministically or randomly in different simulation runs ρ, but remains fixed for all pulses generated in a multi-pulse simulation run ρ.

The VHDL implementation of Algorithm 1 consists of a few fairly simple design entities only: An asynchronous state machine, a threshold gate, sleep and link timers driven by start/stoppable oscillators, and resettable memory flags. The asynchronous state machine, shown in Fig. 7a
                        , consists only of three states, which are visited cyclically: In the (initial) ready state, it waits for the trigger condition in Algorithm 1 to become true. The state machine then proceeds to the firing state, where it emits a pulse, and then moves into the sleeping state. One resettable memory flag per incoming link is used to memorize the occurrence of a pulse from the respective neighbor. It is reset when the state machine takes the transition from the sleeping state to ready, or when the respective link timer generates a timeout. Fig. 7b provides the simple state machine for the memory flag: Starting from the (initial) ready state, it waits for the reception of a trigger message, which results in a transition to the state memorize and the setting of the corresponding memory flag. After the timeout

                        , the memory flag is reset and the state machine returns to the ready state.

The implementation of the above state machine is completely asynchronous and has been generated using the Petrify tool [35]; the designs of the timers, start/stoppable oscillators, and memory-flags are based on the designs provided in [36]. The complete HEX node was synthesized with Synopsys® Design Compiler version C-2009.06-SP4, using the UMC 90 nm standard cell library [37]. Note that we had to augment this library by a custom Muller C-Gate [38] developed in the context of the DARTS project [30,39]. The detailed timing analysis of the HEX node implementation revealed an end-to-end switching delay, without wire delays, in the interval

                           0.161

                        .

Although HEX is, by design, metastability-free in the absence of failures, we cannot rule out the possibility that faulty nodes cause metastable upsets [40] of state-holding devices such as memory flags. However, as laid out in more detail in [36], the probability that a faulty node produces a signal transition within the picosecond-range window of vulnerability is extremely small and can be further decreased by means of synchronizers [11] or elastic pipelines [38]. In our simulations, we may hence safely exclude metastability-inducing behavior.

Using our testbed, we conducted the following types of simulation experiments:

                        (B) Statistical evaluation of the stabilization time. These experiments require multiple pulses. Essentially, the system is started, with every node in an arbitrary state, and then attempts to forward a sequence of pulses generated at layer 0 (with bounded skew and a certain separation time). Using post-processing of the recorded triggering times, we compute the stabilization time as the number of pulses needed for the intra- and inter-layer skews to persistently fall below a layer-dependent threshold.

Both types of experiments were performed with and without faulty nodes of different types. Note that the triggering times of faulty nodes are of course not considered when computing the inter- and intra-layer skews.

We conducted a suite of simulations that complement the analytic intra- and inter-layer worst-case skew bounds given in Theorem 1 by statistical data. First, Fig. 8

Next, we back up the results of our analysis in Section 3.3: We consider f uniformly placed failures under the constraint that Condition 1 holds. In each run, each Byzantine node randomly selects its behavior on each outgoing link as either constant 0 (fail-silent) or constant 1. A typical pulse with a single faulty node 
                           (
                           1
                           ,
                           19
                           )
                        , marked as a red dot, is shown in Fig. 13
                        ; Fig. 14
                         depicts a sample scenario with 5 Byzantine faulty nodes.

In Table 2
                        , we list the statistical results for 
                           f
                           =
                           1
                        . One observes that the behavior for scenarios (i) to (iii) is very similar, hence we will showcase the main points by examining scenario (iii) and (iv) more closely.

                         reveals that skews increase moderately. In particular, the skews increase substantially slower than the derived worst-case bound of roughly

                        . Furthermore, Figs. 15b and 15d show the same data, except that, in addition to the faulty nodes themselves, also their outgoing 1-hop neighbors are discarded from the data set (
                           h
                           =

                        ). Here, a comparison of the case

                           =

                         and any

                           >
                           0
                         reveals that all fault effects have essentially disappeared or are mitigated notably, which confirms that HEX exhibits strong fault-locality. Concerning fail-silent nodes, all results are qualitatively similar, albeit with smaller skews.


                        Fig. 16
                         gives the same plots for scenario (iv). Apart from the expected increase in skews, we observe two points worth mentioning. First, a single fault essentially causes the “worst-case” skew. This demonstrates that, as already indicated by scenario (iii), skew effects of multiple faults do not accumulate, or do so in a very limited way. Second, the maximal intra-layer skews typically exceed the inter-layer skews. An explanation for this behavior is provided in Fig. 17
                        : Intuitively, for “ramped” triggering times generated at layer 0, the pulse propagates “diagonally” (cf. Fig. 9) instead of “vertically” (= layer by layer). This limits the power of the HEX grid to mitigate Byzantine behavior, as it is implicitly optimized for propagating pulse waves vertically.

We now present the results of the multi-pulse simulations conducted for evaluating stabilization time statistics. The same scenarios as in our single-pulse experiments were used here. For the timeouts and the pulse separation time 
                           S
                        , we used nominal values that are compatible with the (scenario-dependent) maximum skew observed for

                        .

For each scenario, fault-number, and fault-type, we executed 250 simulation runs. For each run, f faulty nodes were placed uniformly at random under the constraint that Condition 1 held. Then, starting with all non-faulty nodes in random initial states, 10 consecutive pulses were generated, where placement and behavior of faulty nodes remained fixed during an individual run. For each run ρ, the firing times

                         were recorded; thanks to the large pulse separation times, unambiguously assigning a corresponding pulse number to a triggering time (after initial spurious triggering events ceased) was easy.

Due to the fact that our simulations only cover the first 10 pulses, it could occur that some runs do not stabilize (yet). Even worse, we cannot rule out the possibility that a run which seems stable violates the skew bounds in some later pulse. However, our actual experiments showed that non-stabilizing runs occur only in scenarios in which the a priori chosen skew bound 
                           σ
                           (

                           )
                         was smaller than the maximal skews reported in Table 2, i.e., where 
                           σ
                           (

                           )
                         was too small. We are hence confident that our stabilization time estimates can be considered representative for realistic skew bounds.

                        , HEX usually stabilizes after the very first pulse. For large C, the average stabilization time estimates go up moderately. Given that the number of simulation runs that did not stabilize within 10 pulses was low (
                           <
                           25
                           %
                         even in the most unfavorable scenario), however, we can safely infer that the typical stabilization time of HEX is indeed much lower than the worst-case stabilization time bound 
                           L
                           +
                           1
                         established in Theorem 2. The results verify that the already good self-stabilization properties of the original HEX algorithm reported in [32] are further improved by the additional link timeouts.

Finally, we also computed the stabilization time estimates for the very same scenarios after also discarding the single-hop outgoing neighbors of faulty nodes (
                           h
                           =
                           1
                        ). In this case, HEX turned out to stabilize after the very first pulse in every run. This again confirms the strong fault locality property claimed for the HEX grid.

                     Stabilization time and pulse separation time  The bound on 
                        S
                      given by Condition 2 and Theorem 2 is not a large factor from being optimal: The stable skew σ, which clearly is a lower bound on 
                        S
                     , is at least roughly 
                        2

                              +
                           
                        
                     . Our values of 
                        S
                      are at most roughly 10 times larger; by rule of thumb, we estimate that 
                        S
                      cannot be reduced by more than roughly factor 2. Given that the used values of 
                        S
                      guarantee stabilization within less than a microsecond, we consider increasing the (effective) frequency at which the system can be run the most important issue related to the pulse separation time: given that 
                        S
                        >
                        100
                         
                        ns
                     , a naïve use of HEX as a clocking system results in fairly low operational frequencies. There are several remedies to increase the frequency of the resulting clocks, however.

First, one can try to decrease 
                        
                           
                              d
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                     , ε, and other parameters that affect skews and delays by engineering efforts. The amazing improvements that clock tree engineering achieved over the decades serve to demonstrate that there is great potential for improving HEX via this approach. Second, one may use frequency multiplication to derive faster clocks from less frequent HEX pulses. Last but not least, one can seek to improve HEX from an algorithmic point of view. We now briefly discuss the latter two options.


                     Frequency multiplication  In [32], we presented a scheme that synchronizes local high-frequency start/stop-pable oscillators to the HEX pulses. Each node's oscillator generates a high-frequency fast clock signal for less than the minimum pulse separation time

                     , which has to be less than the pulse separation time

                              (
                              k
                              )
                           
                        
                     , for every node 
                        (
                        ℓ
                        ,
                        i
                        )
                      and every pulse k. Having the high-frequency oscillators generate pulses only in this restricted time window ensures a metastability-free restart of the oscillator with the next pulse (cf. Fig. 20
                     ). Note that the pulse separation time may vary with each pulse at node 
                        (
                        ℓ
                        ,
                        i
                        )
                     , as it depends on 
                        S
                     , the node's position in the HEX grid, the delay uncertainties from layer 0 to L, the initial layer 0 skews etc. It is of course beneficial in terms of achieving a stable amortized frequency of the fast clocks if 
                        
                           
                              Γ
                           
                           
                              min
                           
                        
                      is large compared to the variability of the pulse separation times.

On the other hand, the achievable worst-case skew of the fast clock between neighbors turned out to be equal to the HEX clock skew plus an additive term of roughly 
                        ϱ
                        
                           
                              Γ
                           
                           
                              min
                           
                        
                     , where 
                        ϱ
                        =
                        ϑ
                        −
                        1
                      is the relative drift of the oscillators. This deterioration of the achievable skew prohibits to make 
                        
                           
                              Γ
                           
                           
                              min
                           
                        
                      arbitrarily large. Since 
                        ϑ
                        <
                        1.05
                      for practical oscillators, however, the skew of the HEX pulses will usually dominate the overall skew.

In any case, the performance of the frequency multiplication depends strongly on the engineering parameters 
                        
                           
                              d
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                     , ϑ and ε as well as on 
                        
                           
                              Δ
                           
                           
                              0
                           
                        
                     . Sufficiently good parameters, in combination with stable low frequency pulses generated by HEX, are hence a prerequisite for achieving stable fast clocks with a small neighbor skew.


                     Decreasing skews further  In the fault-free case, we observed intra-layer skews of roughly

                              +
                           
                        
                     . The inter-layer skews, on the other hand, have a higher bound but have a bias of 
                        s
                        ≈
                        
                           
                              d
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                     . Whereas one can compensate this bias by subtracting s at the application-level, as discussed in [32], which reduces the skew appropriately, this cannot mitigate the increase of the skew by a factor 2 or more even in the presence of few faults (cp. Fig. 15): The reason is that the HEX nodes rely on their neighbors in the same layer to “help out” if one of their neighbors in the previous layer is faulty. This incurs an additional signal delay and therefore a substantial increase of the skew. This problem would be mitigated, if not eliminated entirely, via augmenting the HEX topology by connecting each node to additional in-neighbors from the previous layer. This would, through clock multiplication, allow to increase the effective system frequency and also reduce the stabilization time.


                     Embedding  The presented topology can be embedded into a VLSI circuit using two interconnect layers: One simply “squeezes” the cylindric shape of the HEX grid flat. However, this simplistic solution has two substantial drawbacks. First, the now physically close nodes from opposite “sides” of the original cylinder are distant in the grid and therefore may suffer from larger skews. This might entail that actually half of the nodes cannot be used for clocking. Second, it might be difficult to synchronize the nodes at layer 0 due to physical distance.

As a remedy, a slightly modified topology that arranges the nodes of each layer in a circular pattern could be used. To avoid large variations in link lengths, “doubling layers” responsible for “duplicating” the nodes of a standard layer to quickly increase the number of nodes are used; see Fig. 21
                      for an illustration. The resulting topology can be easily embedded into two interconnection layers with little distortion. The analysis from Section 3 provides strong evidence that the resulting skews would not be worse (if not better); conducting the detailed analysis of such variants of HEX is a topic of future research, however.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

We proposed a candidate for a scalable and fault-tolerant alternative for clock distribution in VLSI circuits, multi-core processors, and other hardware devices. Our approach supports multiple synchronized clock sources and is self-stabilizing even in the presence of a large number of non-clustered Byzantine failures of both clock sources and HEX nodes. Theoretical worst-case analysis and elaborate simulation experiments have been used to show that HEX guarantees a small skew between neighbors in the grid.

Part of our current/future work on HEX is to explore the properties of alternative topologies, which may be chosen to improve clock skews and/or resilience. Moreover, we are working on self-stabilizing Byzantine fault-tolerant higher-level services that may benefit from the enticing properties of HEX.

Recall that the various cases encountered in our analysis (i.e., mainly in Lemma 4) are always tackled by the following generic pattern:
                        
                           •

                               on some layer ℓ (“fast node”), which is supposed to be triggered much earlier than its neighbor 
                                 (
                                 ℓ

                               on the same layer (“slow node”).

Derive a lower bound on the triggering time of the fast node in relation to the triggering times of the nodes on the causal path, from the length of the path and the fact that delays are at least

                              .

Derive an upper bound on the triggering time of the slow node, from the bounds on the triggering times of the nodes on the causal path, the fact that delays are at most 
                                 
                                    
                                       d

                              , and bounds on the skew in some previous layers.

We will follow the general structure of the proof of Lemma 4 in terms of the discussed cases, where we also generalize Lemma 2 once it is needed. It is straightforward to see that similar arguments apply to Lemma 3 and Corollary 1, so we will omit these from the discussion.

                      originates in some layer

                        ≥

                     . By the same induction as used in Lemma 2, one can show that every node on the

                        k

                      more than the maximal triggering time of any node on the causal path on diagonal 0. In fact, since the causal path is not necessarily a triangular left zig-zag path here (see Fig. A.22a), the induction itself works only for nodes on or to the right of the causal path which are also above horizontal segments of the causal path. However, the direct proof that establishes the induction basis also shows that the assertion trivially holds for nodes on these horizontal segments also.

When constructing the left zig-zag path ending at

If we would reach the faulty node via the lower-right link, we first backtrack/go one hop to the right before we go down-right and finally down-left (see Fig. 6). Clearly, this makes the causal path shorter and thereby decrease the triggering time bound for the fast node by at most

                     Case 3 Non-V-shaped skews, triangular (

                     ): Neither Case 1 nor Case 2 apply
                  

The reasoning for circumventing the faulty node in the construction of the (now triangular) left zig-zag path in Case 3 of Lemma 4 is the same as for Case 2 above. For computing the triggering time of the fast node, though, we also need to adapt Lemma 2 to cope with a faulty node within the part of the triangle with corners

                              )
                           
                        
                     . Note that the latter possibly needed to evade the faulty node as well, see Fig. A.23a
                     .

Recall that the proof of Lemma 2 proceeds by induction over the left-diagonals of the triangle. As already argued in (2a), the modified shape of the zig-zag path does not invalidate the statement of the lemma. Moreover, if the faulty node has column index smaller than i, its right and upper right neighbors will be centrally and right-triggered, respectively, at most 
                        O
                        (
                        
                           
                              d
                           
                           
                              +
                           
                        
                        )
                      later (if they are not triggered otherwise earlier) than indicated by the bounds derived in the original Lemma 2. Examples of the two basic cases that may occur here are shown in Fig. A.23. This covers all possibilities for Case 3 of Lemma 4, except the ones where the faulty node has column index i or 
                        i
                        +
                        1
                     . In this event, as already argued before, we fall back to considering 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              left
                           
                           
                              i
                              +
                              2
                              →
                              (
                              ℓ
                              ,
                              i
                              )
                           
                        
                      or 
                        
                           
                              p
                           
                           
                              left
                           
                           
                              i
                              +
                              3
                              →
                              (
                              ℓ
                              ,
                              i
                              )
                           
                        
                     , which again allows the causal path leading to the slow node to pass the faulty node on its right.
