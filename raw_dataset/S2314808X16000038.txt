Traveling wave solutions

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  In this article, we established abundant traveling wave solutions for nonlinear evolution equations. The exp(–φ(η))-expansion method is used to construct traveling wave solutions for the generalized Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation and Simplified Modified form of Camassa–Holm equation. The traveling wave solutions are expressed in terms of the hyperbolic functions, the trigonometric functions and the rational functions. The proposed solutions are found to be important for the explanation of some practical physical problems in mathematical physics and engineering.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is well known that seeking exact solutions [1–53] for nonlinear evolution equations (NLEES) plays an important role in mathematical physics. For instance, nonlinear evolution equations (NEEs) are widely used as models to describe complex physical phenomena in various fields of sciences, especially in fluid mechanics, solid-state physics, plasma physics, plasma waves and biology. One of the basic physical problems for those models is to obtain their travelling wave solutions. In particular, various methods have been utilized to explore different kinds of solutions of physical models described by nonlinear partial differential equations (NPDEs). In the past few decades or so, many effective methods have been presented, which contain the inverse scattering transform method, the Backlund transformation [1], bilinear transformation, the tanh-sech method [2], the extended tanh method, the pseudo-spectral method [3,8–10,14,15], trial function and the sine-cosine method [4,5], Hirota method [6], tanh-coth method [2,7,11,13], the exponential function method [16–24], the (G′/G)-expansion method [25–29], the homogeneous balance method [30,31], F-expansion method [33–35] and the Jacobi elliptic function expansion method [36–38] and so on. In a subsequent work, Ma et al. [39] developed the complexiton solutions for Toda lattice equation through the Casoratian formulation and hence obtained a set of coupled conditions which guaranteed Casorati determinants to be the solution of Toda Lattice which consequently produced complexiton solutions. Moreover, Ma and You [40] used variation of parameters for solving the involved non-homogeneous partial differential equations and obtained solution formulas helpful in constructing the existing solutions coupled with a number of other new solutions including rational solutions, solitons, positions, negatons, breathers, complexions and interaction solutions of the KdV equations. It is needed to be highlighted that the basic spirit of the exp-function method which is the conversion of nonlinear partial differential equations into integrable ordinary differential equations was explicitly presented and minutely analyzed in 1996 by Ma and Fuchssteiner [41]. In fact, the exp-function method is restricted to produce rational solutions in the form of transformed variables and such solutions can be obtained easily by making use of other techniques including Wronskian and Casoratian [41–43]. Recently, Ma, Wu and He [44] presented a much more general idea to yield exact solutions to nonlinear wave equations by searching for the so-called Frobenius transformations. Some recently developed methods, such as, the modified simple equation [45–49], the enhanced Exp(–φ(ξ))-expansion method [50,51], the Enhanced (G′/G)-Expansion method [52,53], etc. which provide useful exact solutions to NLEEs have been discussed.

The objective of this article is to apply the exp(–φ(η))-expansion method to construct the exact solutions for nonlinear evolution equations in mathematical physics via generalized Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation and Simplified Modified form of Camassa–Holm equation. The subject matter of this method is that the traveling wave solutions of a nonlinear evolution equation can be expressed by a polynomial in exp(–φ(η)), where φ(η) satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE):

                        -expansion method is very important in finding the exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations. In this article, we have successfully formulated the exact and traveling wave solutions to the generalized Zakharov–Kuznetsov–Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equation and Simplified Modified form of Camassa–Holm equation. The wave solutions are obtained through the hyperbolic, trigonometric, exponential and rational functions. The calculation procedure is simple, direct and constructive. This study shows that the method is quite efficient and much effective for finding exact solutions of nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs). Also, we observe that the method is straightforward and can be applied to many other nonlinear evolution equations.
