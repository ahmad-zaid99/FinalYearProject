@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Present-day computational problems in science and technology must deal with increasingly complex geometric information and applications. The complexity of geometric information stems from a dramatic increase in size, diversity, and complexity of geometric data: point clouds, boundary meshes, NURBs representations, finite element meshes, CT scans, and so on. The complexity of applications is apparent in increasingly complicated semantics, usually expressed in terms of incidences and relations involving geometric data: large-scale assemblies, topology of microstructure, image segmentation, multi-physics simulation, to name a few. Emerging applications require the convergence of shape synthesis and analysis from computer graphics, computer imaging, and computer-aided geometric design, with discrete meshing of domains used for physical simulations. The goals of unification, scalability, and massively parallel distributed computing call for rethinking of the foundations of geometric and topological computing.

The evolution of 3D geometric representations can be generally understood in terms of graph-based data structures representing one of several possible cell complexes partitioning either the boundary or the interior of the represented model. A variety of assumptions about cell complexes and graph representations make standardization difficult, complicate the issues of data exchange and transfer, and lead to the proliferation of incompatible algorithms. Graph-based structures are difficult to parallelize: e.g. boundary representation algorithms are dominated by graph searching algorithms (boundary traversals) that tend to force serial processing. In short, the specialized data structures based on cell complexes, that have driven the evolutionary development of the field, are no longer adequate for dealing with the emerging challenges and opportunities in geometric computing.

We observe that all types of cell complexes and functions over cell complexes are properly represented by a (co)chain complex, that captures all combinatorial relationships of interest in solid and physical modeling formally and unambiguously. Based on classical results from algebraic topology techniques, we show that a (co)chain complex and all associated combinatorial operations are readily represented using standard techniques from linear algebra, giving rise to a Linear Algebraic Representation (LAR) scheme. In this paper, we focus specifically on mod 2 (co)chain complexes because they are sufficient for many solid modeling applications  [1]. In particular, we describe a fully implemented LAR data structure and algorithms using compressed sparse row (CSR) matrices that introduce no computational overhead and are asymptotically as efficient as (and usually better than) many other popular topological data structures. Our presentation will focus on chain complexes and operations. The extension to cochain complexes is straightforward because the two are isomorphic. For example, it is well known that boundary and coboundary matrices are transposes of each other.

The literature on representation schemes in solid modeling started with the foundational paper  [1], where a mathematical framework for the important aspects of computer representations of solids was introduced. The ground-breaking paper  [2] had previously supplied the first but already efficient boundary representation scheme. It also introduced Euler operators, elementary operations for step-wise building well-formed polyhedra, using atomic software actions satisfying the Euler–Poincaré formula at each stage.

The Quad-Edge data structure, providing efficient primitives for planar subdivisions and Voronoi diagrams, was proposed in  [3], and is still largely used in computational geometry algorithms and in geometric libraries. Variations of the radial-edge non-manifold representation by  [4] have been embodied in almost every commercial CAD system that uses a non-manifold boundary representation. The Cell–Tuple structure  [5] was introduced as a simple, uniform representation of finite and regular CW-complexes over subdivided 
                           d
                        -manifolds.

More general set-theoretic and topological operators were provided by  [6] to represent inhomogeneous objects, building upon the Selective Geometric Complex (SGC), a superset of CW-complexes allowing for cells non homeomorphic to open balls, proposed to handle dimension-independent models of point sets with internal structures and incomplete boundaries. A dimension-independent generalization of simplicial schemes, and various operators and algorithms were discussed by  [7]. The foundational ideas underlying these and other representations are reviewed in  [8], pointing out that solid modeling was conceived as a universal technology for developing engineering languages and systems with guaranteed geometric validity.

Despite the tremendous amount of research done and the progress made, most modern industrial systems still follow the basic approach established twenty years ago, centered on boundary representations, graphs, and non-manifold data structures represented using complex and inefficient (usually redundant) pointer structures. Computations in such systems, without preprocessing, usually rely on sequential “traversal” (graph or boundary) algorithms that depend on specific pointer structures, and do not readily scale. For example, handling large 3D unstructured meshes becomes problematic, but the situation is much more challenging for other higher-dimensional topological structures.

More recently, the geometric and physical modeling fields started moving towards computing with functions defined over more general cellular decompositions  [9,10] and direct integration between geometry and physics  [11–14]. These latest developments provided the motivation for the present paper; in particular, we will draw heavily on the ideas, concepts, and definitions in  [12] and  [13] to propose a new linear-algebraic approach to representing and computing with topological structures.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

In this section we introduce the Linear Algebraic Representation (LAR) scheme. The aim is to provide a representation that supports all topological constructions and queries that arise in typical cellular decomposition of space (mesh, image, boundary, etc.). Formally, LAR relies on standard definitions  [15,16]: in the mod 2 cellular complexes used here, 
                           d
                        -chains are sets of 
                           d
                        -cells; the standard basis of the

                         rows. The formulation may be extended to 
                           d
                        -cochains that represent any possible field over the chains, and boundary and coboundary operators provide the computational tools needed by the discrete version of the generalized Stokes theorem for integration of fields over 
                           d
                        -dimensional domains  [13]. Due to space limitations, in this paper we will focus on chain complexes only, but the extension to cochains is straightforward  [13].

Below, we show that the characteristic matrices of a chain complex, i.e. the binary matrices that encode the incidence of 
                           d
                        -cells with 0-cells, provide a convenient tool for computing boundary (and coboundary) operators and answering queries concerning the topological relations between cells. Characteristic matrices are very sparse for actual chain complexes used in applications, and can be represented in a standard CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format. The product and transposition of such CSR matrices, needed to compute the boundary, adjacency and incidence operators between such linear spaces, are intrinsically efficient, since the sparse matrix–vector (SpMV) multiplication is linear in the size of the output.

This fact provides a convenient tool for computing boundary and coboundary operators and topological relations between cells. In particular, in Section  3.3, we show that a boundary operator may be constructed by filtering the matrices

                        Reduced LAR. We now consider a special but common situation where a topological structure is regular 
                        
                           d
                        -complex, where every cell is contained in some 
                           d
                        -cell. In this case, a LAR representation can be simplified further under mild assumptions: 
                           
                              –
                              LAR contains both the

                                 -cells of a regular decomposition of a

                                 -space and of its complement;

any two cells intersect on a connected cell.

                        -complexes are additionally characterized from 
                           d
                        -cells with the same number of vertices, a specially compressed version of the CSR representation may be used, since every row of

                         contains the same number of non-zero elements, and therefore it is not necessary to store the index to the beginning of the storage of the column indices of each row. It is worth noting that the above holds for the important and common case of simplicial and cuboidal 
                           d
                        -complexes, where the number of ones per row of the characteristic matrix is equal to 
                           d
                           +

                        , respectively. Of course, we do not need to store the values of non-zero elements in

                        Compactness of representation. Notice that a reduced and compressed LAR is highly compact. For example, the boundary rep of a triangulated 3-manifold using LAR needs only space

In this section, we show that common topological operations and queries on CSR represented LAR structures, including incidence, boundary, star, and product of spaces, reduce to a sequence of SpMV operations that are asymptotically linear and, with a few exceptions, output sensitive.

For simplicity and concreteness, we first consider the incidence queries that typically arise in a cellular decomposition 
                           Λ

                              )
                           
                         of a 2D space, such as 2D triangulation or the boundary of a solid 3-shape. There are 9 incidence relations between pairs of cells in such a

An application of the star operator arises in allocation of large models across a distributed environment. To execute any distributed simulation, the (image of the) star of each submodel (as a chain) must be allocated on each pair of processes sharing a portion of the submodel boundary. Stars are also used for enforcing continuity of mappings between the complexes, as well as in physics and in mesh processing (e.g., Laplace operators operate on open neighborhoods, and can be easily generated by this operator).

Some elementary examples aim to show the simple computations in the LAR scheme. A non-trivial extraction of complex topological models from 3D image data follows. FV and EV give a CSR rep of the binary matrices

The cellular complex shown in Fig. 1(b) is composed of five quads, described symbolically by quadruples of vertex indices (FV), and is embedded in

To construct a reduced LAR representation, we must append to FV the description of one or more external 2-cells, in this case denoted by the quadruple

                        . The resulting representation FV
                        
                           ≔
                         CSR(

Using the technique introduced in Section  3.2, we first convert the input FV into the (binary) characteristic matrix

In addition to the existing implementation in python, LAR is being developed as a web service in a web-based computational environment, using some Khronos’s APIs (OpenCL server-side and WebCL client-side) for industry standard heterogeneous computing. In particular, LAR is now being used in biomedical applications which require fast performances with big geometric data for topological tasks such as model extraction from 3D images.

                           This work is carried out within the framework of the IEEE-SA Project P3333.2—Standard for “Three-Dimensional Model Creation Using Unprocessed 3D Medical Data”.
                         For instance, density values in medical images represent scalar fields (cochains) over cubical cellular complexes, and LAR is used to guarantee topologically correct 3D image segmentation as well as to extract a/an (enumerative) solid model from the image, which is subsequently smoothed out (see Fig. 2
                        ).

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

In this paper we introduced LAR, a simple linear algebraic representation for cellular complexes, using a CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) form for characteristic matrices of linear spaces of (co)chains. LAR allows us to efficiently compute and query any model topology through sparse matrix algebra, and supports all topological incidence structures, including enumerative (images), decompositive (meshes) and boundary (CAD) representations. LAR is dimension-independent, not restricted to regular complexes, and allows for internal/external structures, including cracks and fibers of lower dimensions. Also, LAR enjoys a neat mathematical format—being based on chains, the domains of discrete integration, and cochains, the discrete prototype of differential forms, so naturally integrating the geometric shape with the supported physical properties. Therefore, LAR appeared to offer a sound basis for a standardization of topological structures and computations.

                      Other promising research directions point towards LAR-based multicore/heterogeneous computing and web computations with distributed models and parallel algorithms.
