                  Transcendental curves, or in general those resulting from offsetting, do not admit an exact rational or polynomial representation and must hence be approximated in order to incorporate them into most commercial CAD systems. We present a simple, yet general geometric tool for polynomial approximation, based on piecewise Hermite interpolation with

                      quasi arc-length parameterization, a desirable property for robotics or CNC. We take the osculatory Hermite interpolation, prescribing position, tangent direction and curvature at the endpoints, and add quasi arc-length conditions, by imposing unit speed and vanishing tangential acceleration. These new conditions fit naturally into this scheme, yielding a quintic with Bézier points that turn out to display extremely simple geometry. In addition we consider a lower degree alternative to the quintic, namely a cubic B-spline. Finally, we include two examples of applications (the approximations of regular offsets and the clothoid) and compare our results with those from commercial systems or existing methods.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Curves in CAD are usually represented by employing a polynomial or rational parameterization, expressed in Bernstein basis and its B-spline extension. However, remarkable cases, such as the offset or transcendental curves, do not admit this representation. In consequence, they cannot be incorporated directly into most commercial systems and must be approximated in some way. Another expressive shortcoming of the standard rational model [1–3] is that it cannot yield curves with exact arc-length parameterization [4,5], aside from the trivial case of a straight line.

Most approximation methods concentrate on generating a good approximant in the sense of being close to a given curve, by guaranteeing a maximum distance. However, this requisite does not suffice for applications requiring a smooth parameterization, where smooth usually means at least 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      and close to the ideal arc-length (also called intrinsic or natural parameterization). An example where parameterization plays a key role is a trajectory whose parameter is taken as proportional to time. A smooth parameterization with approximately unit speed is desirable for CNC machining, or the definition of trajectories for robotic manipulators. Parameterization is also of paramount importance in skinning (traditionally known as lofting) [1], where several section curves are connected to generate a smooth surface. If the section curves are unevenly parameterized, the resulting surfaces display poor quality. Finally, even in case a curve admits an exact rational representation, such as the circle, a polynomial approximation may be required to improve its parameterization.

To achieve a quasi arc-length approximation to a given curve, a first option would be to sample points on the curve and construct an interpolant that tries to minimize its speed deviation from unity by some optimization technique, as done in [6,7] using a quintic spline, or in  [8] with a cubic B-spline. We advocate instead a simpler, more geometric alternative that reproduces not only positional data but also tangential and curvature information from the original curve, by using a modified Hermite interpolation technique. The remaining degrees of freedom of the interpolant are employed to impose the quasi arc-length condition, namely unit speed and vanishing tangential acceleration at the endpoints. Thus, our approach is aimed at representing in an approximate manner, with the bonus of a smooth parameterization, those curves that do not fit into the NURBS model.

The article is arranged as follows. First, in Section  2 we set the Hermite conditions for the interpolant and consider two alternative solutions (a piecewise Bézier quintic and a cubic B-spline). Remarkably, the quasi arc-length condition results in extremely simple geometry for the control points. We apply our tool to approximate regular offset curves (Section  3) and the clothoid (Section  4), a notable transcendental curve, comparing our results with those from commercial CAD software. Finally, conclusions and extensions of this work are outlined in Section  5.

Apply twice knot removal  [1,9] at each internal knot, down to multiplicity 3.

Finally, Fig. 2 illustrates the case of a planar open segment, although it clearly extends to 3D curves, or closed curves by selecting a breakpoint corresponding to both

                        , the offset (6) to a polynomial or rational curve is not expressible in the NURBS standard, except for simple cases, such as a straight line or a circle, and the so-called Pythagorean-hodograph curves  [16]. Therefore, in some commercial systems offsets are represented in a procedural manner  [17], as a reference to the base curve plus the distance 
                           d
                        . Anyway, computing a NURBS approximation seems the only viable method to introduce offset curves into general CAD/CAM systems and guarantee compatibility.

The offset operation displays remarkable properties [18], sketched in Fig. 5:

                         may not be adequate for certain applications, so there is no point in trying to reproduce it, for instance using traditional parametric Hermite interpolation  [19]. In contrast, the quasi arc-length parameterization introduced in Section  2 furnishes a more sensible alternative, in fact independent from the actual parameterization of

                        .

There exists a rich literature on offset approximation (see the surveys [12–15] and Section 11.2 in the book  [20]), although most methods focus on minimizing some distance between the exact and approximated offset and none tries to mimic the arc-length parameterization. In this section, we briefly review some of the most relevant methods for offset approximation, used in the upcoming Section  3.4 for comparison purposes. Clearly, methods leading to gaps when connecting two approximations, such as those based on Legendre series  [21], are ruled out for the approximation of smooth curves.

A first option is to sample points on the exact offset and interpolate them, for instance with a

                                 n
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                           
                         B-spline curve of degree 
                           n
                        , as advocated by Piegl and Tiller  [22]. The main advantage of this method is its generality, as it easily carries over to offset surfaces, as well as to generalized or functional offsets. Another option is approximating the unit circle 
                           
                              n

                        (6), that is, the Gauss map shared by the offset and generator. Lee et al.  [23] present several alternatives that generate a

In our case, recall that we are not reproducing the customary parameterization (6), which makes the Hausdorff distance a very convenient option to express the admissible tolerance between

                         where to perform the subdivision (Section  2.1) to refine the approximation, instead of simply at the midpoint.

This section contains an example for smooth offset approximation, taken from the articles cited in the preceding section. We chose a simple cubic generator 
                           
                              c
                           
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                        , because its offset does not display irregular points. First, we include a comparison (Fig. 6
                        ) with the offset tool available in Rhinoceros®  4.0  [28], a popular commercial NURBS-based modeler. This tool always generates a cubic B-spline approximation, so the user has no control over the degree of the approximation and can only set a “tolerance” in a dialog box, which after some numerical experiments turns out to be very close to the Hausdorff distance between the approximant and exact offset. The result was transferred from Rhinoceros into Mathematica®, via IGES file format, for analysis purposes. We compare this offset tool with our quasi arc-length quintic, setting a tolerance 
                           ε
                           =
                           1
                           
                              
                                 0
                              
                              
                                 −
                                 3
                              
                           
                         in both our method and Rhinoceros dialog box. As the speed plot indicates, our quintic yields a smoother parameterization, even when it employs fewer control points (albeit resorting to a higher degree). Table 1
                         lists the number of control points for a wider range of values 
                           ε
                        , as well as the results for our cubic B-spline alternative. Our solutions match the accuracy of Rhinoceros, but we enjoy the plus of the quasi arc-length parameterization and 
                           
                              
                                 C

                         endpoint interpolation. For comparison purposes, in Table 1 we added data from the methods by Ahn et al. [25], as well as by Ahn and Hoffmann [26], based on circle approximation.

For the sake of completeness, Table 1 also includes data from Piegl and Tiller  [22], and Lee et al. [23]. Piegl and Tiller’s method is the best one, followed by our quintic, yet the latter outperforms Piegl and Tiller’s method as the error tightens. However, any conclusions should be drawn with care, since these two works do not resort to the Hausdorff distance to express the tolerance. Other aspects should be considered, because our method cannot guarantee an “a priori” tolerance, which can only be checked after construction.

Another practical application for our quasi arc-length interpolant is the approximation of transcendental curves, which being non-algebraic do not admit a rational parameterization and are not expressible in the NURBS standard. A remarkable example is the clothoid, also known as spiral of Cornu or Euler’s spiral, characterized by displaying a curvature that varies linearly with its arc-length. Because of this important property, clothoidal segments are used in the route design of highways and railways, or trajectories for automatic guided vehicles, to achieve smooth transitions between lines and/or circles [29–32].

The complex representation greatly facilitates the analysis of planar curves, such as the clothoid. Adhering to the notation employed in Farouki’s book  [16], we use a bold character to denote both points of the Euclidean plane and complex numbers, regarded as interchangeable. A clothoid

Unfortunately, the integral (10) is a transcendental function that cannot be solved symbolically. As in the offset case, there exists a rich literature on methods for approximating the clothoid. All existing approximations involving non-polynomial functions, such as square roots [33] or a mixture of polynomials and trigonometric functions  [34,35], are problematic for CAD, because they are NURBS-incompatible and would require further approximations. Similarly, those leading to gaps when trying to connect two approximations, such as the classical Taylor expansions, are also inadequate. Traditional least-square approximation neither guarantees contact at the endpoints, so additional constraints must be imposed, as done in  [36,37] when using a rational Bézier segment. Another option is the approximation by arc splines  [38], which, albeit only

                         continuous, enjoys the advantage of a very simple offset (arc splines again).

Not surprisingly, most approximations to the clothoid are based on some sort of Hermitian spline, with segments generated by Hermite interpolation. Regarding polynomial approximations, Wang et al.  [39] simply blend the two Taylor expansions at each endpoint of a clothoidal segment, incurring in the cost of a degree as high as

                         to achieve

                         continuity, so quintics would suffice to achieve 
                           
                              
                                 C

                        . This approach is investigated in  [40], where a modified Newton form is used to compute two-point Hermite expansions. We could also use geometric Hermite interpolation, to achieve a higher geometric continuity for a given degree  [41]. However, since this technique takes advantage of the freedom in the choice of the parameterization, it would destroy any arc-length parameterization.

                        , as done in [35], because the original curve is already parameterized by arc-length and hence this error indicates the deviation from the ideal curve. Fig. 8 plots the quintic and the cubic B-spline (5) approximations, which display similar error and speed.

For comparison purposes with a commercial system, unfortunately we cannot use Rhinoceros, as in Section  3.4, since it does not incorporate any built-in tool to approximate the clothoid. We resorted instead to MicroStation®  V8i  [42], a package intended for civil engineering based on the Parasolid®  kernel [43], which incorporates a clothoidal spiral tool. In the corresponding dialog box, the user chooses a “tolerance”, as well as the length and “degree of curvature”, related to 
                           κ
                           
                              (
                              t
                              )
                           
                        , at the endpoints. Since this software employs piecewise Bézier cubics to approximate the clothoid, we also used our cubic B-splines (Section  2.3), rather than quintics. We devised an example (Fig. 9
                        ) with similar number of control points in both MicroStation and our cubic spline, and compared the Pythagorean errors. In MicroStation, a 
                           “tolerance”
                           =

                         yields a cubic B-spline with 13 control points. With our cubic spline, we get 12 control points by simply subdividing the interval

We present a general tool for polynomial approximation, based on piecewise Hermite interpolation with 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      quasi arc-length parameterization, a desirable property for many applications. The main idea is using a quintic for Hermite interpolation of positions, tangents and curvatures at the endpoints, and employing the remaining degrees of freedom to impose unit speed as well as zero tangential acceleration and the endpoints, and hence mimic the arc-length parameterization. These additional conditions also guarantee a 
                        
                           
                              C

                      piecewise curve, if several interpolants are concatenated, instead of

                      continuity.

Besides its generality, the main advantage of our method is its sheer simplicity, in contrast with the complexity of the osculatory cubic needed for

                      Hermite interpolation. The control points of the quintic Bézier interpolant turn out to have projections regularly spaced on the tangent lines, i.e., they display locally a nonparametric geometry taking as abscissa axis the tangent line. We also consider a lower degree alternative to a Bézier quintic, namely a piecewise 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      cubic B-spline with two internal knots, and in consequence also 6 control points. Both alternatives enjoy linear precision, recapturing the only case where a polynomial curve admits an exact arc-length parameterization.

Our tool is aimed at situations where a smooth parameterization is required. A first example is the approximation of regular offsets. Most methods try to approximate the customary offset parameterization, which displays lower parametric continuity than the generator, despite that the offset inherits the geometric continuity of the generator. In contrast, for a 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      generator our Hermite interpolant yields an offset approximation that is 
                        
                           
                              C
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                      too. Another example of application is the approximation of transcendental curves, such as the clothoid, that should try to reproduce their original arc-length parameterization to display some remarkable property. The control points for an arbitrary clothoidal segment admit straightforward explicit expressions. The approximation of the offset to a clothoid and other transcendental curves, such as the helix, is a straightforward exercise. Despite its generality and simplicity, our proposal compares favorably with specific methods for offset approximations and matches tools available in commercial systems.

Regarding possible extensions, a clear option is trying to optimize the selection of the internal knots in the cubic B-spline alternative, which provide two additional degrees of freedom with respect to the quintic. We could also carry over our model from polynomial to rational approximation. To display a vanishing tangential acceleration, now the control points should have projections on the tangent line following the conditions for linear precision of rational Bézier curves [2,44]. The additional degrees of freedom provided by the weights could be employed to achieve circular precision, and lower degree or more accurate approximations, albeit at the cost of increased complexity.
