@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  An all-optical flip-flop based on a nonlinear multi-section DFB semiconductor laser structure is proposed. Holding beam is not required for device's operation. A section of the DFB structure is detuned to prevent lasing in the “OFF” state, and it is accompanied with a negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at Urbach tail. At a high light intensity in the structure the nonlinear coefficient reduces the detuning, and the device is in lasing state; “ON” state. The device is reset by an optical pulse at a shorter wavelength through cross gain modulation. The reset pulse is absorbed in a middle section in the device before reaching the detuned nonlinear section. The switching times between the states are in nanoseconds time scale.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

All optical Internet requires all optical devices to process optical data directly (without conversion to electrical signal) in the optical domain. Particularly, all-optical flip-flops have roles as all optical memory elements, and these memory elements could be used in all optical data routing [1]. The all-optical flip-flop could be used for other applications such as optical shift register, optical random access memory and other applications [2]. Several schemes/devices are suggested for all-optical flip-flop devices. In [3], a device that is based on two coupled laser diode is presented. A device that is constructed from ring laser is presented in [4]. A device with two states of a clockwise and an anti-clockwise laser mode is introduced in [5]. Devices that are based on a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser, and on vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifier (VCSOA) are shown in [6] and [7] respectively. All these devices require a holding beam or show output power in both states of the flip flop. Devices that have bistable optical output and do not require a holding beam are discussed in [8,9]. These devices have a saturable absorber in the laser cavity which has large optical loss at low light intensity in the laser cavity, and optical loss is reduced at high optical power intensity in the cavity.

In [10], a chirped DFB laser structure that behaves as an all-optical flip-flop is simulated. The flip-flop has a bi-stable output optical power behavior. The operation of the device does not require a holding beam. The chirped grating is accompanied by a linearly increasing negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail (The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs density that reduce the refractive index close to the band-gap energy). In the “OFF” state the chirp prevents constructive feedback from the grating and lasing does not occur. At high light intensity,the chirp is reduced due to negative nonlinearity, and the laser mode builds up. The device is switched “OFF” by cross gain modulation. An optical pulse of a wavelength longer than the operating wavelength reduces the gain of the active layer, and in the same time does not produce much change in the refractive index (lower absorption coefficient at a longer wavelength).

In this work, a new design for an all-optical flip-flop is simulated. Instead of the chirped grating accompanied with a linear increasing negative nonlinear coefficient, a part of the wave-guiding grating of the suggested device is detuned from the rest of the grating. The detuned part has a slightly higher refractive index than the rest of the grating and has a negative nonlinear coefficient. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail. The structure investigated in this work is easier to fabricate than the structure mentioned in [10] because only one nonlinear section is needed to achieve optical bistability in the laser device. The switch OFF (“Reset”) mechanism is done by cross gain modulation (XGM), and a “Reset” pulse at a wavelength shorter than the wavelength of the “Set” pulse is used. The “Reset” pulse has a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) than the “Set” pulse and the operating frequency, which produces more design flexibility. This is in contrast to the device in [10], where the the “Reset” pulse has to be at a lower frequency than the operating frequency. In the next section the device schematic is presented and the flip-flop design is discussed.

The suggested device consists of a nonlinear DFB laser structure. The refractive index distribution along the wave-guiding layer of the device is shown in Fig. 1
                     . The grating period is adjusted as

                      is the wavelength at the center of the reflection band of the grating. The device has a phase shift section in the middle of the grating. The optical gain is provided by electrical current injected into the active layer along the wave-guiding layer. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to direct absorption of photons at the Urbach tail at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap energy in the nonlinear section. The loss coefficient at the Urbach tail is expressed as:

                      is the Plank's constant (The energies are expressed in electron volt). The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap. At low optical power intensity in the structure, the detuned part of the wave-guiding layer reduces the available optical feedback to the laser mode, and the laser mode does not build up. To set the flip-flop “ON”, an optical pulse of wavelength λ = λ
                     1 is injected, at z = 0, where λ
                     1 = λG
                     . The semiconductor band gap energy Eg
                      in the nonlinear section is adjusted such that the photons energies at λ = λ
                     1 is slightly less than Eg
                     . Fig. 2
                      shows the gain spectrum of the device [13], the “Set” and “Reset” pulses frequencies (wavelengths), and the optical loss at Urbach tail. The injected “Set” pulse induces electron-hole pair densities in the nonlinear section and reduces its refractive index and its detuning; hence it provides extra optical feedback to photons of wavelength around λ = λ
                     1, the optical mode builds up and provides optical power (photons) that produce electron-hole pairs in the nonlinear section and maintain the reduction in the detuning in that section.

To reset the flip-flop, an optical pulse at λ = λ
                     2 is injected at z = 0. In this work we choose λ
                     2 < λ
                     1, which means that the reset pulse will be absorbed in the nonlinear section and may prevent the flip-flop from switching “OFF” properly. At

                     2 (Fig. 3
                     ). In Section “1”, the band gap energy is higher than “Set/Reset” pulse photons energies. In section “2”, the “Reset” pulse will be absorbed because the band gap energy is lower than the “Reset” pulse photon energy. The “Reset” pulse energy is totally absorbed in section “2” before it reaches section “3”. Section “3” is the detuned grating section, its band gap energy is slightly higher than the “Set” pulse photon energy and the output laser mode photon energy.

                     2 = 1450 nm (Window of low absorption loss in optical fiber). The reset pulse reduces the optical gain of the laser mode by XGM, and it is absorbed in section “2”. Whence the optical laser mode gain is reduced the light intensity at λ = λ
                     1 is reduced and electron-hole density in section “3” decays toward zero, the optical feedback in the cavity is reduced and the device is switched OFF. In the next sections, a mathematical model of the device is presented an solved numerically. “Set/Reset” dynamics are simulated in time domain and results are discussed.

To simulate the switching dynamics in the structure coupled mode equations are used to model optical fields inside the structure [14]. The optical modes are coupled with rate equations. The total optical field is expressed as:

Equations 1 and 2 present the two counter propagating modes in the device. Equation 3 describes the “Reset” pulse propagation in the structure. Γ1 presents the detuning along the structure due to optical gain change and refractive index change, and it presents the optical loss in the cavity. Γ2 is the coupling between forward mode and backward mode. In the simulations

                     1. A part of photons is absorbed and electron-hole pairs are generated. The electron-hole pairs generated reduce the refractive index at photon energies just below the energy gap of the semiconductor. At photon energy below the band gap energy the loss follows Urbach tail expression [12],

The structure is divided into 80 sections. In each section, the forward and backward fields are calculated using Rung-Kutta methods. The electron hole densities in the wave-guiding layer and the active layer are calculated with the same methods. In each step, random fields are added to the backward and forward mode to model the spontaneous emissions. To reduce the simulation time, the simulations are performed on a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU). In each time step, the calculation load is distributed among 80 parallel threads; a thread per each section along the length of the structure (one can assign more threads per section). The integration step along the z axis is L/80, and the time step is

To determine the required injected current to obtain two stable optical level output (at the same injected current) a numerical experiment is performed. The injected current is increased linearly from zero to 0.122 Ampere in 75 ns, then the injected current is reduced again to 0 linearly in 75 ns. At part of the current versus optical output relation is plotted in Fig. 5
                        . In the following simulations, the injected current I = 95.523 mA is assumed. It insures bistable operation of the device.

The output optical power in the “OFF” state at z = L is simulated in time domain for 75 ns, Fig. 6
                        (a). The “ON” state is triggered by an input pulse injected at z = 0, of power P = P

                        1 is amplified along the structure and a part of photons is absorbed at the Urbach tail in the third section (the nonlinear section). The absorbed photons generate electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index of that section. As the detuning of this section decreases, the grating in this section starts to reflect back more photons back to the device and decreases the number of photons leaving the device at ω = ω
                        1. The optical feedback along the structure increases and the laser mode at ω = ω
                        1 builds up. As the optical power of the laser mode builds up, it maintains the number of photons in section 3 that are required to generate the electron hole density needed to set the detuning of this section to a low value.

The “Reset” pulse at ω = ω
                        2 is amplified in the first half of the device. In section “2”, the pulse is absorbed almost completely due to large attenuation coefficient. The amplification of pulse in that section is neglected compared to the large attenuation by the semiconductor of band gap

                        1 by XGM. When the optical gain of the laser mode is reduced, the photons absorbed in section “3” are reduced, and also the electron hole pairs generated in the wave-guiding layer in that section are reduced, the refractive index increases and the detuning is restored to its value in the “OFF” state. The “Reset” pulse at ω = ω
                        2 is totally absorbed in section “2”, it does not reach section “3”, and does not affect the electron hole densities in section “3”. As the “Reset” pulse is absorbed in section “2”, it generates electron hole pairs that changed the detuning for the laser mode along that section. The refractive index distributions during “Set/Reset” operation in both sections “2” and “3” at successive time frames are shown in Fig. 13

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The device operation requires altering the band gap of the semiconductor material in the wave-guiding layer. This could be done as the device is fabricated from InGaAsP alloy on InP substrate. By changing the percentage of the InGaAsP alloy ingredient, the band gap could be changed [18]. The extinction ratio is

                      to reach steady state in a shorter time. During “Set/Reset” operation (Fig. 10), a “Reset” pulse of width 0.9375 ns is injected to the device; however, the output optical output power takes about 2 ns to reach the optical level of the “OFF” state. The “Reset” dynamics in time domain are shown during Nc
                      transition state (before Nc
                      reaches transition state) in case of single “ON/OFF” (or “Set/Reset”) operation (Figs. 10–12) and at the end of Nc
                      transition state (9 ns after “Set” pulse) during multiple “Set/Reset” operation (Figs. 15–17).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this work, an all-optical flip-flop based on a non-linear semiconductor DFB laser structure is introduced. The “Reset” mechanism uses an optical pulse of a shorter wavelength than the “Set” pulse wavelength. The device could be built using InGaAsP alloy. Simulations show that a “Set” pulse of 0.1875 ns pulse width switched the device “ON” and optical mode stabilizes in 0.5 ns. A “Reset” pulse of 0.9375 ns pulse width switches the device “OFF” in 2 ns. The switching dynamics are in nanoseconds time scale and it is suitable for all optical data packets routing.
