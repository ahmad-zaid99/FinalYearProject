                  In this paper, we present an approach that automatically constructs a trivariate tensor-product 
                        B
                     -spline solid via a gradient-based optimization approach. Given six boundary 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces for a solid, this approach finds the internal control points so that the resulting trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid is valid in the sense the minimal Jacobian of the solid is positive. It further minimizes a volumetric functional to improve resulting parametrization quality.
                  For a trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid even with moderate shape complexity, direct optimization of the Jacobian of the 
                        B
                     -spline solid is computationally prohibitive since it would involve thousands of design variables and hundreds of thousands of constraints. We developed several techniques to address this challenge. First, we develop initialization methods that can rapidly generate initial parametrization that are valid or near-valid. We then use a divide-and-conquer approach to partition the large optimization problem into a set of separable sub-problems. For each sub-problem, we group the 
                        B
                     -spline coefficients of the Jacobian determinant into different blocks and make one constraint for each block of coefficients. This is achieved by taking an aggregate function, the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function value of the elements in each block. With block aggregation, it reduces the dimension of the problem dramatically. In order to further reduce the computing time at each iteration, a hierarchical optimization approach is used where the input boundary surfaces are coarsened to difference levels. We optimize the distribution of internal control points for the coarse representation first, then use the result as initial parametrization for optimization at the next level. The resulting parametrization can then be further optimized to improve the mesh quality.
                  Optimized trivariate parametrization from various boundary surfaces and the corresponding parametrization metric are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Isogeometric analysis is a numerical analysis technique where CAD basis functions are used to represent both geometry and the approximate physical field  [1]. It has emerged as an important numerical analysis technique and offers the potential to bridge CAD and finite element analysis. A prerequisite in isogeometric analysis is the availability of CAD basis based volumetric parametrization of the physical domain since a geometric representation in CAD systems provides only boundary definitions. Towards this end, this paper provides an approach that can automatically construct a trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid from a given set of six boundary surfaces or from a boundary triangulation. A trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid establishes a mapping that maps a cubic parametric domain to a 3D physical domain. A mapping that is useful for many practical applications such as finite element or isogeometric analysis is one that does not involve self-intersection or folding. One way to ensure that the mapping is free from self-intersection is to ensure that the Jacobian of the mapping does not change sign. In this paper, we find the internal control points to maximize the minimal Jacobian of the 
                        B
                     -spline solid. When the minimal Jacobian is positive, the mapping is free from self-intersection. This approach further minimizes a volumetric functional to improve resulting parametrization quality.


                     Fig. 1
                      gives an example of constructing a 
                        B
                     -spline solid from a boundary triangulation. Fig. 1(a) shows the input triangles and Fig. 1(b) shows the reconstructed 6 compatible 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces. Fig. 1(c), (d), and (e) are respectively the initial constructed 
                        B
                     -spline solids, the optimized valid 
                        B
                     -spline solid, and the solid with improved parametrization. The colour represents the Jacobians. Bézier patches with negative Bézier coefficients of 
                        det
                        J
                      are shown in shaded colours and the control points that affect them are shown in blue points. It can be seen that the Bézier patches on the neck intersect each other. In Fig. 1(d) the mesh is valid. The Bezier patches in Fig. 1(d) now have all positive Bézier coefficients of 
                        det
                        J
                      except the zero coefficients on the boundary edges. It can be seen that the elements on the neck no longer intersect each other (see the boxed area in Fig. 1(c) and (d)). After mesh quality improvement, in Fig. 1(e) the mesh becomes much smoother than that in Fig. 1(d) (see the circled areas in Fig. 1(d) and (e)).

Our basic approach is as follows. From the boundary triangulations we reconstruct simultaneously six valid and compatible boundary 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces with optional 
                        G
                        1
                      smoothness across the boundary curves and corners. From the boundary 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces, we use deformation techniques to create an initial 
                        B
                     -spline solid that is valid or near-valid. We then maximize the minimal 
                        B
                     -spline coefficient of 
                        det
                        J
                      until a valid 
                        B
                     -spline solid is obtained. This is possible since the Jacobian of a 
                        B
                     -spline solid is a high order trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline. The minimal Jacobian is thus bounded by the minimal 
                        B
                     -spline coefficient of 
                        det
                        J
                     .

For a trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid even with moderate shape complexity, direct optimization of the Jacobian of the 
                        B
                     -spline solid is computationally prohibitive since it would involve thousands of design variables and hundreds of thousands of constraints. We have thus developed several techniques to address this challenge. We use a divide-and-conquer approach to partition the large optimization problem into a set of separable sub-problems. For each sub-problem, we group the 
                        B
                     -spline coefficients of 
                        det
                        J
                      into different blocks and make one constraint for each block of coefficients. This is achieved by taking an aggregate function, the Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser function value of the elements in each block. With block aggregation, the dimension of the problem reduces dramatically. In order to further reduce the computing time at each iteration, a hierarchical optimization approach is used where the input boundary surfaces are coarsened to difference levels. We optimize the distribution of internal control points for the coarse representation first, then use the result as initial parametrization for optimization at the next level. At last, we further improve the mesh quality by minimizing a volumetric functional and several parametrization metrics are used to evaluate the mesh quality.

Our approach extends earlier work in 2D parametrization where minimal Jacobians of 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces are maximized  [2,3]. Optimization approaches to 3D parametrization have been attempted. In  [4], a variational approach for generating NURBS parametrization of swept volumes is presented. In  [5] an optimization based approach for generating trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solids is also presented. However, as shown in this paper, direct optimization is only applicable to small scale problems. Other approaches to volumetric parametrization for isogeometric analysis have also been developed. In  [6], a tetrahedral mesh was parametrized based on discrete volumetric harmonic functions and then fitted to a single skeleton based trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solid. Instead of having six exterior surfaces, it only has one exterior surface with singularities on the inner skeleton axis. In  [7], a method of converting an unstructured quadrilateral and hexahedral mesh to a rational 
                        T
                     -spline was proposed. Based on the method in  [7], in  [8], solid 
                        T
                     -splines were constructed from the triangular boundary representations for genus-zero geometry. Further, in  [9], a method of constructing solid 
                        T
                     -splines from boundary triangulations with arbitrary genus topology is given.

Thus far few of the above approaches have addressed the quality of the parametrization. Even though isogeometric analysis is shown to be robust even under severe mesh distortion  [10], the statistics in  [11] suggests that the mesh quality influences the accuracy and convergence of the analysis solutions. In this paper, besides the Jacobian, we evaluate the resulting mesh metrics such as orthogonality, Oddy metric and condition number.

In this paper, for brevity, we abbreviate the determinant of the Jacobian matrix as the Jacobian. According to Lemma 1, a solid mesh has singular points if it has a zero Jacobian and has a self-intersection area if it has both positive and negative Jacobians. By properly determining the

                           w
                         directions, we could have that, for a valid solid, we have all positive Jacobians and for a self-intersecting solid, we have both positive and negative Jacobians. An all positive Jacobian means 
                           min

                              (
                              det
                              J
                              )
                           
                        . In this paper, we focus on the 
                           B
                        -spline solid and we express 
                           det
                           J
                         of a 
                           B
                        -spline solid in the form of a higher order trivariate 
                           B
                        -spline. We can thus obtain the bound of 
                           min
                           
                              (

                         from the
                           B
                        -spline coefficients of

                           J
                        . Via maximizing the minimum
                           B
                        -spline coefficient of

                           J
                        , we can obtain a

                        -spline solid as the design variables and all the

                        -spline surfaces, so in our implementation, we exclude all the coefficients at the edges and corners from the constraint list.

Direct maximization of the minimal Jacobian as shown in (5) is both time consuming and memory inefficient. For a degree

                         as constraints can only be used for small size models, for example, with less than 1000 control points. Next, we present four computational techniques to make the formulation applicable to practical 3D problems.

Four techniques have been developed to tackle the challenge. Firstly, several initialization methods for rapidly generating near-valid initial 
                           B
                        -spline solids are proposed. After some comparisons, the method of deformation governed by the elastic equilibrium equation gives better initial solids. With good initialization, we thus have a 
                           B
                        -spline solid with a very small number of invalid Bézier patches that are scattered in the solid instead of having a larger number of invalid patches throughout the whole solid. Thus, a divide-and-conquer method is then applied to optimize the isolated groups of invalid Bézier patches separately, which significantly reduces the problem size. Constraint aggregation can further reduce the size of the optimization problem by reducing the total number of constraints. Hierarchical optimization uses a good coarse solid as the initial model for the fine solid optimization. Thus, the computing time at the fine level is reduced at the cost of solving an additional coarse and small optimization problem.

                         and use its internal control points as the initial parametrization for

                                 α
                                 −
                                 1
                              
                           
                        , let 
                           α
                           =

                           −
                           1
                         and go to step 2; if yes, end this process. When hierarchical optimization is desired, 
                           H
                         is usually 2 or 3. Otherwise, 
                           H
                           =
                           1
                         corresponding to single level optimization.

We maximize the minimal 
                           B
                        -spline coefficient of 
                           det
                           J
                         until it is positive. For brevity, when a Bézier patch has a negative Bézier coefficient of 
                           det
                           J
                         in (3), we refer to the patch as an invalid Bézier patch. Our optimization approach obtains a valid 
                           B
                        -spline solid by changing all the invalid Bézier patches into valid ones.

A good initialization method is critical for reducing the number of iterations in gradient-based optimization. A good initialization method also creates a 
                              B
                           -spline solid with fewer isolated invalid Bézier patches that can be subsequently handled in a divide-and-conquer manner. The inputs for initialization are six valid and compatible

                           Deformation method. The second type of initialization method is through deformation. We deform a cuboid discretized with hexahedral grids to the given shape with the boundary nodes of the cuboid in six sides deformed to the corresponding control points of the six surfaces. The resulting internal grid points of the cuboid thus become the initial internal control points of the

                           -spline solid. We solve this deformation through the finite element or finite difference method.

One main benefit of having a good initialization method is that the resulting 
                              B
                           -spline solid is near valid, i.e. most of the Bézier patches are valid and the invalid Bézier patches are scattered and may be separable. The divide-and-conquer approach exploits the separability of invalid Bézier patches to reduce the original large optimization problem into a set of separable small sub-problems. That is, instead of optimizing the whole 
                              B
                           -spline solid, isolated groups of invalid Bézier patches are optimized separately.

In Fig. 5
                           , there are three isolated groups of invalid Bézier patches, noted as

                           . Since they are isolated from each other we can optimize them separately. In the optimization of

                                  are separable from each other.

Separable groups can be optimized independently while non-separable groups must be optimized simultaneously since moving any control point of one group will have an influence over the other. The criterion for two groups to be separable is given in Lemma 4.

Based on Lemma 4, we group those invalid Bézier patches into different separable groups. Then we can optimize these groups one by one as in (5), yet the problem dimension for each group is now substantially smaller than the entire 
                              B
                           -spline solid due to far fewer 
                              B
                           -spline control points being involved in each sub-problem.

As shown in Section  3.1, direct optimization faces challenges of handling a large number of constraints. Even with a divide-and-conquer strategy, sometimes we still have a considerable number of constraints. We thus propose to use constraint aggregation [17,18] to effectively reduce the number of constraints. A single Bézier solid has

                              2
                           , then we have 
                              M
                              =

                              729
                           . So even with relatively good initial 
                              B
                           -spline solid and a small number of invalid Bézier patches, we still have thousands of Jacobian constraints. Using the constraint aggregation strategy, we can reduce the number of constrains to tens or hundreds which would help reduce the running time in optimization. A simple constraint aggregation can be achieved through a Kreisselmeier–Steinhauser (KS) function

                            which leads to poor convergence in optimization. Thus, we replace this simple aggregation with block aggregation. That is,

                           -spline coefficients in each block. Such a separation in numerical values of

A further technique developed for efficient optimization in this paper is through hierarchical optimization. The hierarchical optimization is useful when initialization fails to produce a near-valid 
                              B
                           -spline solid. We optimize the coarse mesh first, then refine the coarse mesh and use the internal control points of the coarse mesh as the initial model for fine model optimization. Using this strategy, we can obtain good initial control points in the fine level optimization and can reduce the optimization time at the fine scale. Reducing the problem scale in the fine optimization level at the cost of an additional coarse optimization can be very profitable since the coarse optimization usually involves a much smaller problem.

As the inputs of the hierarchical optimization, multilevel models are obtained by coarsening the fine boundary surfaces

                            in the hierarchical optimization as shown in Fig. 3, both divide-and-conquer and constraint aggregation strategies are used.

We evaluate the mesh quality with the following metrics.

                         will give very good statistics in the condition number metric and Oddy metric. Since (16) is a global volumetric functional, the solution thus would lead to improved mesh quality in an average sense.

As shown in Fig. 7
                     , the input is a closed boundary triangulation. We partition the boundary triangulations into six areas, each area corresponding to one face of the hexahedral solid. Then, by applying the harmonic parametrization method  [8], the boundary triangulations are parametrized in the sense that each vertex has unique parameters

                        =

In Fig. 9
                         we compare the resulting 
                           B
                        -spline solids from the four initialization methods on the duck model. The deep coloured shaded patches in this figure are the invalid Bézier patches. It can be seen that deformation through elasticity leads to the fewest number of invalid Bézier patches. It also involves the least optimization time for obtaining a valid duck solid with positive minimal 
                           B
                        -spline coefficient of

                           J
                        . In Table 2
                         we compare the number of invalid Bézier patches for the four models (duck, femur bone, human head and tooth) from four initialization methods. It is clear from Table 2 that deformation through elasticity leads to the fewest invalid Bézier patches for all four models. Since the number of optimization variables and the number of Jacobian constraints both increase linearly with the number of invalid Bézier patches, the optimization time increases quadratically with the number of invalid Bézier patches. Thus in the remainder of this paper, we use the deformation through elasticity to generate the initial 
                           B
                        -spline solid.

                         show the process of obtaining a valid solid with its minimal Jacobian maximized until it is positive. They start with respectively 6 input

                           B
                        -spline solids are obtained where invalid Bézier patches are shown in deep shaded colour. Upon optimization, all Bézier patches become valid, i.e. with positive minimal Bézier coefficients of 
                           det
                           J
                        . Figs. 11 and 12 show the hierarchical optimization process where the optimization at a coarse model can be used to reduce significantly the number of invalid Bézier patches in the fine model. Table 4 further compares the effects of various techniques on optimization time where technique O stands for direct optimization without any technique, technique D stands for the Divide-and-conquer technique, technique C stands for the Constraint aggregation technique, and technique H stands for Hierarchical optimization. The symbol ‘/’ means that the process is too long to count the time. As the table shows, with the elasticity based deformation as the initialization method, the divide-and-conquer approach is most effective. Combining the divide-and-conquer technique with the constraint aggregation technique can lead to even faster convergence. In all these cases, it usually only takes 1 or 2 iterations to find a valid model, i.e. the minimal Jacobian becoming positive. Hierarchical optimization becomes helpful when the model from the initialization does not lead to many separable invalid Béizer groups, and the coarse model and fine model are similar as in the head and tooth examples. It should be pointed out, in all examples, without using the above developed optimization technique, the process would either fail to find a valid

                        -spline solid or the process would be too long for it to be practically useful. Table 3
                        
                         gives an example in the reduction of problem size for the duck model. As show in Figs. 1(c) and 5, with the initialization, the duck model is divided into three separable invalid Bézier patch groups. Table 3 compares the number of optimization variables (number of internal control points), number of Jacobian constraints, and the number of constraints with constraint aggregation before and after the application of our optimization techniques. For the invalid Bézier patch group on the duck neck, before constraint aggregation we need 4.0 s for one iteration in the optimization, after constraint aggregation we need 1.7 s for one iteration.

With the above valid 
                           B
                        -spline solids, we further minimize the functional (16) on the four models with the goal of improving mesh quality. Due to the space limitation, only two of the four models, the duck model and the head models, are shown here. Figs. 13 and 14

                         and

                        . From the figures, we can observe that the mesh becomes much smoother after mesh quality improvement. The condition number metric and Oddy metric both become smaller and also smoother as there are larger warm colour areas. The orthogonal metric becomes larger as there are larger blue coloured areas.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

In this paper, we have presented an optimization approach with a set of techniques that can efficiently create a valid trivariate tensor-product 
                        B
                     -spline solid from different boundary inputs. Our study finds that deforming a cuboid to a given boundary shape through elasticity leads to good initialization in the sense that it generates a near-valid 
                        B
                     -spline solid. Such a near-valid solid leads to fewer invalid Bézier patches (with negative minimal Bézier coefficient of 
                        det
                        J
                     ) scattered throughout the solid. This makes it possible to separate the invalid Bézier patches into groups where each group can be optimized independently. Such divide-and-conquer has proven to be very effective and reduces the original large-scale optimization problem into a set of smaller sub-problems. The combination of divide-and-conquer, constraint aggregation and the hierarchical optimization have proven to be effective in obtaining valid trivariate 
                        B
                     -spline solids from a set of boundary triangulations or given set of six boundary 
                        B
                     -spline surfaces.

Minimizing the volumetric stretching and bending energy functional has led to an improvement of the overall mesh quality in terms of the Oddy measure, condition number and the orthogonality of 
                        B
                     -spline elements. Future work shall consider the mesh improvement for the worst-quality elements, rather than all elements. Since our approach only deals with genus zero objects, future work would integrate our optimization approach to domain decomposition approaches so complex topologies can be parametrized.
