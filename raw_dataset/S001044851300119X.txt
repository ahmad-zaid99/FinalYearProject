                  One of the aims of statistical tolerance analysis is to evaluate a predicted quality level at the design stage. One method consists of computing the defect probability

                      expressed in parts per million (ppm). It represents the probability that a functional requirement will not be satisfied in mass production. This paper focuses on the statistical tolerance analysis of over-constrained mechanisms containing gaps. In this case, the values of the functional characteristics depend on the gap situations and are not explicitly formulated with respect to part deviations.

This new approach is compared with an existing one based on an optimization algorithm and Monte Carlo simulations. The whole approach is illustrated using two industrial mechanisms: one inspired by a producer of coaxial connectors and one prismatic pair. Its major advantage is to considerably reduce computation time.

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In very competitive industrial fields such as the automotive industry, more and more interest is being paid to the quality level of manufactured mechanisms. It is very important to avoid warranty returns and manage the rate of out-of-tolerance products in production, which can lead to assembly line stoppages and/or wastage of out-of-tolerance mechanisms. The quality level of a mechanism can be evaluated by the number of faulty parts in production or by the number of warranty returns per year. However, these two methods of product quality evaluation remain a posteriori. Tolerance analysis is a more interesting way to evaluate a predicted quality level at the design stage. Scholtz  [1] proposes a detailed review of classical methods whose goal is to predict functional characteristic variations based on component tolerances. Moreover, statistical tolerance analysis enables the definition of the probability that the functional requirement will be respected or not, as does the well-known RSS (Root Sum of Squares) method.

Advanced statistical tolerance analysis methods allow the defect probability of an existing design to be computed, knowing the dimension tolerances and functional requirements. These are called probabilistic approaches and this paper focuses mainly on them. Various assumptions about the statistical distributions of component dimensions can be made, based on their tolerances and capability levels. For example, the APTA (Advanced Probability-based Tolerance Analysis of products) method proposed by Gayton et al.  [2] enables random mean deviations and standard deviations of components’ statistical distributions to be considered during the whole manufacturing phase. Defect probability, noted

                      is usually computed based on a classic analytical chain of dimensions. Nigam and Turner  [3] list most of classic methods which enable

                      to be computed. In addition, several methods from the structural reliability field can be used  [4].

In some over-constrained mechanisms, gaps are present, allowing part displacements. Thus, depending on the gap situations, different dimension chains are required to control one functional characteristic. The formulation and computation of

                      for such mechanisms are not straightforward, and classic methods which deal with chains of dimensions cannot be used. Over-constrained mechanisms can be faulty because they cannot be assembled, or because they are not functional. Thus, two defect probabilities are defined: the assembly defect probability

                      and the functionality defect probability

The present paper focuses mainly on the functional requirement issue, because of its greater complexity compared to that of assembly. Nevertheless, the assembly issue is mentioned in the sections concerned. Section  2 is devoted to presenting existing methods capable of dealing with these issues and details one in particular. It has already been used  [5] and is based on an optimization algorithm and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Only MC simulations are required to compute 
                        
                           
                              P

                     . This methodology is very precise in general but requires a large number of runs (optimization runs for the functionality issue). The main contribution of this article is an innovative methodology detailed in Section  3 and inspired by the work of Ballu et al.  [6]. It greatly decreases the computational effort. Both assembly and functionality defects are expressed as dependent event intersections.

                     . Both approaches are compared for two industrial mechanisms: one inspired by a coaxial connector supplier (Fig. 1
                     ) and one prismatic joint (Fig. 2
                     ). The results are given and commented in Sections  4 and 5. The proposed method can be adapted to other over-constrained mechanisms featuring gaps.

In the literature, gaps are often neglected, mainly because only iso-constrained mechanisms are studied. In over-constrained mechanisms, they have to be taken into account  [6–8]. To study such mechanisms, all mobilities between parts, arising from the presence of gaps, have to be considered. For this purpose, a new formulation of the tolerance analysis issue based on the quantifier notion was developed by Dantan and Qureshi  [9] and Qureshi et al. [5]:
                           
                              •
                              The mathematical expression of tolerance analysis for the assembly requirement is: For all acceptable deviations (deviations which are inside tolerances), there exists a gap situation such that the assembly requirements are verified.

The mathematical expression of tolerance analysis for the functional requirement is: For all acceptable deviations (deviations which are within tolerances), and for all admissible gap situations, the functional requirements are verified.

In the manufacturing phase, several deviations appear due to manufacturing processes. These are called manufacturing deviations. Many imperfections types are identified in a geometrically toleranced mechanism. With a view to simplicity in this paper, only dimensional deviations are considered. As it is commonly agreed in the literature  [6,3,1], deviations 
                           
                              D
                           
                           
                              (
                              ω
                              )
                           
                         are modeled by random variables where 
                           ω
                         is the hazard. Their means are the nominal values, while their standard deviations depend on the process characteristics. The authors are currently investigating applications involving positional (location and orientation) deviations. These new deviations are also modeled as random variables. The number of concerned variables increases but the whole resolution methodology is the same. Nevertheless, considering positional deviations in a 3-dimensional context could lead to highly non-linear functions which then have to be piecewise linearized. These developments will be covered in further publications. According to the literature  [10], form deviations are negligible compared to positional ones. Thus, they will be omitted in the presented study and the following ones. To take gaps into account, part positions are modeled by deterministic free variables 
                           
                              P
                           
                        . These variables are not considered as random, since part displacements cannot be controlled, but only limited by part dimensions. In 3 dimensions, a part has 6 degrees of freedom (3 translations and 3 rotations) which involve 6 displacement variables 
                           
                              P
                           
                         per mobile part.

As a preliminary step, it is useful to determine whether the mechanism, composed of several parts, can be assembled. As Dantan and Qureshi  [9] express it, one gap situation has to be found such that the assembly requirements are verified. Assembly is possible if all assembly constraints are respected:

The defect probabilities defined above can be computed thanks to the well-known Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method  [5]. Due to the presence of gaps, the functionality formulation requires all the admitted part positions to be taken into consideration. To ensure this, an optimization algorithm is called for each sample of random variables

The first presented methodology uses MC simulations, but it requires millions of optimization runs. The objective of this new approach is to reduce that computation time.

As previously stated, to deal with the functionality issue, all the part position situations have to be taken into consideration. The first methodology is global, since it considers all the contact points at once (i.e. the

                         non-interference constraints). In fact, it is possible to decompose the global defect event into several identified ones, each one relative to a contact point situation. This is the aim of the proposed methodology. This approach is called “system” since the problem is composed of a system of events. The advantage of this approach is that the position variables disappear in Eq. (12) for a given contact point situation.

                         is still not trivial. It can be simplified in two ways: firstly, the number

                         of considered situations can be reduced; secondly, unions of intersections can be transformed.

                         contact point situations are realistic in the dimension variation domain. Some of them are mechanically unfeasible, extremely rare or redundant with others. For all these reasons, an identification phase is recommended to ascertain the dominant situations. Ballu et al.  [6] do this by knowledge and expertise, but it is not always possible. Another possibility is to run the optimization used in the first methodology a small number of times (

This method, which is not obligatory, enables a significant reduction in the number

This method can easily be applied to compute both defect probabilities

In this section, a case study is presented, based on an industrial problem. It is a 2D representation of an electric coaxial connector designed and manufactured by RADIALL SA, comprising 2 cylindrical parts (see Fig. 4
                        ). Due to the presence of gaps in the mechanism, part 1 is mobile while part 2 is fixed. The position of part 1 is located in 2D space thanks to the displacement variable vector: 
                           
                              P

                        . Rotational symmetry is taken into account by constraining

                         positive. Dimensions

                        .

This coaxial connector can be assembled if the dimensions of part 1 are lower than the corresponding dimensions of part 2, if the following assembly constraints are verified:

                         results computed by MC simulations and by the FORM system. Both computation methods give comparable results in a very short time because this assembly issue is trivial. However, it is interesting to note that the FORM system methodology provides the exact probability result instantaneously while MC simulations provide a confidence interval on the result.

Concerning the functionality issue, the non-interference domain

                         shows the whole defect area in the same space. The complete defect area is the union of individual defect areas relative to each contact point situation. Some lines cannot be displayed since they are outside the frame. Some lines are also merged with others. It is interesting to note that most defect areas have common limits and are disjoint. Nevertheless, the third and fourth ones have a common intersection. This figure helps to understand the necessity of using the Poincaré formula to compute

The goal of this application is to show that tolerance analysis can be conducted at a very low computing cost using the FORM system methodology for simple over-constrained mechanisms with gaps. Different solution methods are proposed based on the two presented methodologies, using both linear and non-linear non-interference constraints. Results in ppm are listed in Table 3
                         with their 95% confidence intervals (C.I.).

                         is approximately equal to 300 ppm. The FORM system results have also a 95% C.I. due to the Genz method. The low difference between the two MC results shows that non-interference constraint linearization has no measurable impact on

                        . Also, as the FORM system results are very close to those of MC (Table 3), it shows that the FORM linearization phase has no measurable impact either. This argues that the FORM system methodology can deal with this kind of problem with a very low computing cost (10 min as opposed to 10 h).

To give an idea of the weight of each dominant contact point situation, the individual defect probabilities associated with each situation were computed as

Now let us consider a second industrial case study, already presented by Ballu et al.  [6] and Wu et al.  [15]. The new proposed methodology is applied to compute defect probabilities for this mechanism. It is a prismatic joint composed of 2 shafts {3, 4}, one bearing {1} and one other part {2} (see Fig. 7
                        ). The axles slide in part {1} and are attached to part {2} by hooping. Part {1} is fixed, while parts {2, 3, 4} are positioned in the vertical direction thanks to displacement variables

                         (see Fig. 7). Parts {2, 3, 4} are designed to move mainly in the horizontal direction, but this study will investigate only vertical displacements, and horizontal movements are not considered here.

                         define the horizontal positions of parts which are fixed. They are modeled by deterministic variables. Due to manufacturing defects, the shafts are not parallel, their borings are not coaxial with them and their dimensions are not at their nominal values. Thus, gaps are introduced between shafts and borings, allowing displacements. Dimensions

                        . As in the previous application, both methodologies give comparable results, but the computation cost of the MC method is significantly higher than that of the FORM system. This application confirms the ability of the FORM system method to deal with functionality issues very efficiently.

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

Statistical tolerance analysis is a key step in the design phase for industrial products. Probabilistic approaches provide very useful tools for tolerance analysis. The goal is to compute defect probabilities of over-constrained mechanisms containing gaps; the latter represent the main difficulty here, since they cannot be modeled as random variables. In fact they are free and have to be considered as deterministic variables. This point greatly complicates the solution process. In addition, these kinds of mechanisms are specific, because their non-conformance is caused either by assembly defects or by functionality defects. This paper shows that assembly issues are often trivial, whereas functionality issues are complex due to the presence of gaps.

Concerning functionality issues, the paper proposes an innovative methodology from the structural reliability domain. The authors propose to compute

                      defect probability using the FORM system method. Several contact point situations are treated separately as dependent events. Their intersection is taken into consideration thanks to the multi-dimensional Gaussian cumulative distributive function

                     , computed by the Genz method. The proposed methodology is compared with another existing method based on MC simulations and optimizations. The two industrial applications show that both presented methodologies give equivalent results. The proposed method enables the computation of defect probabilities for mechanisms containing gaps at a very low computing cost (a few minutes compared to several hours). The FORM system methodology is remarkably accurate and can be applied to other mechanisms containing gaps on which several contact point situations can be identified to respect functional requirements. Its efficiency is also linked to the linearity of non-penetration constraints to ensure that extreme functional characteristic values are obtained at the contact points.

In the case of more complex mechanisms with gaps whose behavior is governed by highly non-linear functions, the constraint linearization phase could lead to errors in defect probabilities. In future work, it would be interesting to deal with this kind of system.
