@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  A finite element study based on 1D beam element model is performed in order to investigate the mechanical behavior of an elasto-plastic beam loaded in axial compression over its buckling limit. The mode of loading is related to the damage of truss-cored beams in truss-cored laminates. The analysis takes into account the effects of geometry and material properties. The results of the FEM analysis are used for developing a simple mechanical model based on the basic Euler–Bernoulli beam theory and accounts for the beam compressibility. The model uses phenomenological functions containing parameters related to the basic material and geometrical properties. The presented model is developed in the form of closed solution which does not require complex numerical methods or extensive parametric studies. Predictions of the compressive stiffness degradation of truss-cored composites are made with the proposed model and compared with the results of FEM simulations. The error of the stiffness prediction with respect to the FEM results is within 10% over a 5 fold range of stiffness.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Composite structures with a truss core are possible candidates for lightweight applications as they provide a high stiffness/density ratio. Extensive studies of such materials have demonstrated their ability to fill the gaps in material properties space [1,2]. The truss-cored laminates provide particularly good performance because they belong to the group of stretch dominated structures which avoid bending dominated failure [3,4]. Many studies have focused on optimizing the design of ideal truss-cored structures for different loading types [5–8]. Less is known about how the performance of these structures changes when plastic ‘damage’ is introduced. Such deformation can occur as the result of an accident or as an intentional shape change during manufacturing. The example of ‘damage’ during the compression and bending of the truss-cored composite laminates is illustrated in 
                     Fig. 1. With deformation, the stiffness degrades because buckled struts undergo bending dominated deformation and the performance approaches that of stochastic structures such as foam-cored structures [9]. The evolution of the stiffness degradation was reported in [10] but it has not been analyzed in any detail. Understanding the rate of this degradation is the objective of the present study.

The damaged (bended) struts in the truss core are dominantly loaded in bending, therefore the problem of their stiffness degradation can be analyzed using theories of beam bending [11]. The problem is geometrically non-linear. It was first examined for a linear elastic bar and its solution relies on elliptic integrals. The typical example is the cantilever beam solved by Bisshopp and Drucker [12]. An overview of other linear elastic problems solved using elliptic integrals can be found in the book by Frisch-Fay [13].

The main limitation is that the elliptic integrals can be analytically solved only in some special cases. Wider application of these type of solutions as well as the development of new ones occurred with the application of numerical methods such as the Runge–Kutta method [14], numerical integration [15] and weighted residual solutions [16]. Subsequently, efforts have been made to account for non-linear material behavior [17–21]. Elasto-plastic material solutions have been proposed in several studies (e.g. [22–24]). Again, numerical methods are necessary. Examples of practical applications of curved beam theory include composite materials like non-woven felt [25] and Hybrid Stainless Steel Assembly (HSSA) sheets [26].

The objective of the present study is to offer a simple alternative solution that can be applied to the case of an elasto-plastic curved beam which has been ‘damaged’ by previous compressive loading over its plastic buckling limit. The properties of the elasto-plastic beam are investigated using FEM simulations and the output is then used in the model derivation.

This paper is organized as follows: the next section describes the geometrical and material properties of the modeled beams and verifies the FEM model. The third section contains the derivation of the model. The fourth section contains the evaluation of the results of FEM simulations of a single beam and the truss-core and their comparison with the model predictions. The paper is concluded in Sections 5 and 6.

A finite element analysis is performed to obtain information about the stiffness and the mechanical response of an ideal and damaged beam during buckling under the compressive loading. The influence of the beam aspect ratio, initial damage and material properties are investigated. The FEM simulations were performed using large displacement analysis in the commercial ABAQUS code. A convergence study was performed in order to design a suitable FEM model which provides sufficient level of accuracy together with low computation costs. The convergence was tested on 6 different meshes. Two were based on 1D quadratic beam elements with density of 50 and 100 elements per beam length. The remaining four meshes were made with 3D quadratic brick elements. The mesh densities given by the number of elements along the cross-section and length are: 3×3×50; 3×3×100; 5×5×50; 5×5×100. Elastic solutions provided by 1D and 3D FEM models were compared to each other and to the Euler theoretical solution. 
                     Fig. 2 illustrates the comparison of reaction force (a) and beam midpoint ‘sideways’ deflection (b). Reaction force and imposed axial strain are normalized by Euler theory predictions. Fig. 2 shows that all models provide very similar predictions of the reaction force and the deflection. There is notable difference in the prediction of the initial deflection for the beam model with 100 elements. The reason for this was not investigated in detail as the 50 element model agrees very well with the 3D model predictions. Because the present study is not focused on the local distributions of the variables, the 1D model with 50 elements was chosen as it provides sufficient accuracy with low computational cost.

The geometry employed for the main simulations is a simple beam with a square cross-section and fixed ends. A compression is implemented into the model by way of a prescribed displacement of one beam end in the axial (x) direction. Damage occurs through a multistep simulation. The beam is initially loaded over the buckling limit to a certain level of the compressive strain (max 10% i.e. l
                        
                           UL
                        ≥0.9l
                        0). The displacement boundary condition is suppressed in the second step, to allow elastic relaxation to occur. The resulting buckled beam is then used in further FE analysis of the performance during a second loading step. The boundary conditions and the simulation steps are illustrated in 
                        Fig. 3. The validity of the FE model is limited to beams with an aspect ratio a/l
                        0<1/10. Therefore, the cross-section dimensions are chosen to fit this requirement. The dimensions of the beams are shown in 
                        Table 1.

The basic idealized hardening curve is taken from tensile tests of an AA 5083 aluminum alloy. Young׳s modulus values are chosen to cover the range of light metals (magnesium–aluminum) which show promise for applications in the truss structure composites. The input for the FE code requires stress vs. plastic strain data. Other materials in the set are simply produced by calculation of the new stress values for given plastic strain ε

                        Table 2 and the stress–strain curves are shown in 
                        Fig. 4a.

In order to achieve a buckling instability in the FE simulations, it is necessary to introduce initial geometrical perturbations into the perfect initial geometry. These perturbations follow the shape of the first buckling mode and help to develop the corresponding buckling shape and achieve the numerical stability of the simulation. The amplitude of these perturbations must be carefully chosen to minimize any artificial influence on the results. An amplitude of 0.02a is chosen in the present case. The perturbations cause the beam to be loaded in bending from the very beginning. Therefore, its maximum ‘sideways’ deflection increases even before it reaches the buckling point. The effect is illustrated in Fig. 4b. The plot shows evolution of normalized deflection (D/a) with increasing axial strain (ε
                        
                           UL
                        ) normalized by the elastic buckling strain obtained from Euler theory (ε
                        
                           B
                        ). The beam deflection increases from the start and the sharp change in slope signifies the plastic buckling limit.

Analysis of the results of simulations using elasto-plastic material reveals that predictions of post-buckling behavior are affected by the magnitude of the deflection at the point of plastic buckling. The larger the deflection at the plastic buckling limit is, the smaller and more unrealistic is the strength of the beam during post-buckling behavior. Based on this analysis, a limit for simulation validity is set to D/a≤0.03 for simulations using elasto-plastic material (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 4b). All simulations in which the normalized deflection D/a at the plastic buckling limit exceeds 0.03 are disqualified from further analysis. This is the case for combination of a=10mm with E=43,000MPa (solid and dash-dotted black curves in Fig. 4b), therefore an increased Young׳s modulus E=73,000MPa is used for the simulations with this cross-section.

A simple model for estimation of the stiffness of a buckled beam under the compressive loading is proposed. Its derivation is based on the results of the FEM simulations and it is explained in the following section. The model uses the basic Euler–Bernoulli theory of bending which is limited to small deformations. This restriction affects the model so its validity is set to a maximum of 10% of initial damage.

The general definition of the stiffness can be written as

Let us consider a beam with fixed ends and cosine buckling shape with ‘sideways’ midpoint deflection D. The moment along the beam produced by the compressive force F applied at the end is shown in

                        FEM
                     ). The ratio of these forces is shown in Fig. 3c with respect to the deflection D. The difference is less than 15% within the proposed range of validity. Large discrepancy at smaller deflection is caused by the dominance of beam compression over bending. This discrepancy is diminished in the estimates of D and Δ

                      in the further development of the model. The solution which includes a real cosine shape of the buckled beam leads to elliptic integrals which, in general, cannot be solved analytically. Therefore the shape of the beam is approximated by an arc as shown in 
                     Fig. 6a. This simplification allows derivation of relatively simple relations between the deflection D, the axial length l

                     The arc approximation underestimates the deflection compared to the real cosine shape with the same axial and the total beam length, but the difference is within 10% for our considered range of damage. It is usually more convenient to replace the absolute values of the lengths by the relative measure of the strain in the corresponding directions. Therefore these strains are introduced related to the initial unloaded beam length l

The first part of the model describes the behavior of the initially straight beam during its first loading. Therefore an extra index ‘L’ is added to the strain variables but their definition remains unchanged from to the previous description. While the axial strain ε
                     
                        UL
                      is easy to calculate from the distance of the beam end points, the compressive strain depends on the beam geometry (length, cross-section, deflection) and the material properties (Young׳s modulus, yield stress, hardening). In order to get an explicit calculation of D, it is most suitable to express the compressive strain as a function of the axial strain.

                     Fig. 7a. The elastic buckling strain depends only on the beam geometry and its boundary conditions and it can be expressed as

Each curve in Fig. 7a can be divided into three regions. The first region describes the elastic compression of the straight beam as the strain level is below yielding and buckling. This is characterized by ε

                     . The second region starts at the yielding point (ε

                     These expressions are the result of an application of the simple functions which are able to follow FEM data. Selected function must closely fit an evolution of the compressive strain especially at the beginning of buckling (second region) as the force F and stiffness K are sensitive to its value in this region.

                      where the condition of fitting is to have the same tangent at point [2.15; 1] as the function for the second region. This condition ensures a smooth transition of stiffness values at the region boundary. Sensitivity of the force and stiffness to the compressive strain is significantly smaller in this region, therefore a match between the function and the FEM data does not need to be as precise as in the second region. Despite their complex appearance, the proposed functions contain only four parameters which can be easily obtained from the material and the geometrical properties.

Eqs. (12)–(18) describe the evolution of the deflection with respect to the axial strain of the originally straight beam during buckling. However, the primary objective is to calculate the stiffness of the beam which was damaged by previous loading beyond its buckling limit. In order to describe the relation between the compressive and the axial strain for the damaged beam, an elastic relaxation term must be added into the model. Such relaxation occurs when the initial load is removed and the beam is returned to the unloaded state with some residual damage. An extra index ‘R’ is added to distinguish the strain values after the elastic relaxation. An estimate of such relaxation is based on the calculation of the strain profile through the beam cross-section. The procedure is depicted in 
                     Fig. 8. According to the Euler beam theory, the strain through the cross-section can be expressed as

                     The problem with the calculation of the relaxed strain values is such that it works easily in the direction from the compressive strain to the axial strain. However in reality the axial strain is usually known and the compressive strain must be calculated. Inversion of the problem does not provide an explicit solution therefore a ‘discretization’ procedure needs to be introduced to overcome this problem.

This procedure is based on the creation of an a priori set of discrete values

                     for the initially damaged beam. The indices i+1 and i denote the interval in which the value of ε
                     
                        U
                      is placed. Number of points in the a priori sets is not limited so the ‘discretization’ can represent the original curves very precisely. The measured values of ε
                     
                        U
                      are then inserted into the discretized model and the corresponding values of ε
                     
                        C
                      are calculated. Both values are then used in calculation of the corresponding beam deflection D which can be input into Eq. (7).

The last remaining parameter is the increment of the displacement Δ
                        D
                      in the middle of the beam with respect to the increment of the displacement of the beam ends Δ
                        U
                     . The relation between these two variables can be expressed using the ratio D/a for given damaged beam, where D is calculated by the model and a is known from the beam geometry. The relation between Δ
                        D
                     /Δ
                        U
                      vs. D/a is shown in Fig. 7b. Each curve reaches its maximum at the point D/a=0.8 which is also the dividing point for the fitting curves which are expressed as

The results are divided into two main outputs. The first one describes behavior of the beam made of elasto-plastic material under compressive loading and it is illustrated in 
                        
                        
                        Figs. 9–11. The theoretical buckling shape for given boundary conditions follows the function cos(2x), but an introduction of plasticity affects the shape of the beam during the initial loading. This effect is illustrated in Fig. 9 where the difference between the real mid-point deflection (D
                        
                           L
                        ) and the theoretical one (D
                        
                           IS
                        ) for the same beam total length is plotted against the ratio of the axial to total length. The closer the point in the plot is to the value [1;0], the higher the stiffness that can be expected as the beam is loaded closer to the pure compression state. Plasticity generally increases the ‘sideways’ beam deflection but its effect can be moderated by increasing the beam aspect ratio and/or by using material with lower yield stress and higher hardening rate.

The other important aspect related to the stiffness is the elastic recovery or relaxation after the initial loading. The relative amount of the elastic relaxation is shown in Fig. 10 where the horizontal axis represents the relative relaxation in the total length and the vertical axis describes the relaxation in the deflection. The elastic recovery tends to occur more in the length than in the ‘sideways’ deflection. As would be expected, the highest amount of relaxation is obtained for material with a high yield stress and a high hardening rate.

The overall stiffness evolution for different materials and aspect ratios is shown in Fig. 11. The stiffness degradation is mostly influenced by the beam aspect ratio. The material parameters have only a minor influence. A remarkable phenomenon is the high rate of the stiffness degradation with the amount of the initial damage.

The quality of the predictions given by the proposed model is assured in 
                        Fig. 12 by comparing it FE simulation results. The model closely predicts the evolution of the normalized stiffness with the initial damage. It tends to overestimate the FEM values due to its underestimation of deflection (see Eq. (13)). However, the relative error histogram shows that the difference is, on average, less than 10% over a 5 fold stiffness range, which is a reasonable result.

The model enables us to create a stiffness degradation ‘map’ showing the relation between the beam aspect ratio, the relative stiffness and the initial axial deformation. Such a map is shown in 
                        Fig. 13 where the lines represent the level of the stiffness degradation (e.g. 0.9 means E
                        
                           beam
                        =0.9E
                        
                           mat
                        ). Thus, this plot shows the maximal value of the initial damage for given aspect ratio to keep the beam stiffness above the certain level. The rate of the degradation can be then represented by the density of these lines. An illustrative example can be drawn from the plot. Even for the thick beam, only 3% of initial damage is sufficient to decrease the stiffness by 50%.

The derived model can be applied to predict the stiffness degradation of a truss-cored laminate. The mechanical properties of damaged truss core were experimentally measured by Queheillalt et al. [10]. He studied behavior of the extruded pyramidal lattice truss sandwich structures under compression. The geometry of the tested truss core is shown in 
                        Fig. 14 a. The relative density of this core is 6.2%. The struts in experiments do not meet the condition for aspect ratio required in the model (a/l
                        0<1/10), therefore another structure with the same inclination angle and struts length, but with a relative density of 3.1%, was created (see Fig. 14b). Experimental data are therefore used only for validation of the FE model. The comparison between FEM and derived simple model is made only for the structure with 3.2% density. The truss core is modeled with 3D quadratic cubic elements with a mesh density of 50 elements per truss length. The experimental structures are made of A6061 T6 aluminum alloy so the material parameters for simulations are taken from [10,27]. The boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 14 and represent fixed end beams in the core under compression. 
                        Figs. 15a illustrate the comparison of the truss core stress/strain (σ

                        Fig. 16. The correspondence between the experiment and the simulation is very good taken into account limited information about the experimental setup and the FE model can be assumed well identified. The stiffness of the perfect truss core is analytically expressed as

The discrepancies can be attributed to the particular experimental setup and possible damage initiation which is not included in the model. The slender structure shows steeper decrease of stiffness and the proposed model is able to predict this degradation with a difference of less than 15% compared to the FE simulation. The other interesting finding is the higher value of the initial stiffness in FEM compared to the analytical expression. This difference increases with decreases slenderness of the beams and indicates that the validity of the ideal analytical solution presented by Eq. (34) is limited.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

The results of the current study show that the compressive stiffness of the damaged beam is driven by its geometry. This is not a surprise and it is a consequence of a transition from compressive to bending loading in the damaged curved beam. Therefore, the crucial variables are the bending moment which is inversely proportional to the deflection, and the cross section moment of inertia together with the elastic modulus which represents the resistance against further bending. Higher cross section moment of inertia is the main reason for smaller deflections and higher stiffness of the thick beams. The damaged beam geometry is determined by its initial buckling. The beam buckling shape is dominantly given by the beam dimensions and its boundary conditions however the material properties play also a role in the initial beam deflection as plasticity increases the deflection amplitude. The best material option is low yield stress with a high strain hardening rate as such material decreases the amount of stored elastic energy and high hardening rate helps to dissipate energy which could otherwise serve as a driving force for bending. The material properties take more important role during the elastic relaxation period after the initial loading is removed. Larger relaxation decreases the amount of residual damage therefore higher yield stresses and/or hardening rates have a positive effect on the damage reduction.

The proposed model is based on several approximations, which help to simplify the equations and allow the derivation of a relatively simple solution which does not rely on complex numerical methods. The approximations replace the complex real moment distribution and the unknown deflections by those for a central force in the transverse direction. Basic Euler theory is used together with the small deformation assumption which allows the difference between the axial and real beam length to be neglected. According to the FEM simulations, the difference between these lengths is less than 7%. However, the considered range of initial damage is out of the small deformation limits, the model still provides relatively precise results. The possible explanation is that the model experiences the effect of a mutual error cancelation. Using the real length l
                     
                        C
                      in Eq. (7) leads to an underestimation of the resulting force while the arc approximation leads to an overestimation of the force through the underestimated deflection D. Therefore the introduced errors cancel out and the resulting force estimate is close to the real value. The model accuracy is also penalized by our imposed requirement of a small number of parameters which should be obtained without prior extensive study. Despite these restrictions and simplicity, the model is able to estimate the stiffness of the beam damaged by buckling for up to 10% of an initial damage.

A qualitative transition from compressive to bending mode with all its effects previously described must therefore impose significant consequences on performance of structures like the truss-cored laminates. This is confirmed by the experiments and the FE simulations. The simulated thick beams core indicates relatively slow degradation rate but it still loses about 40% of its initial stiffness with 10% of damage. The slender beams core loses about 80% of its initial stiffness at the same level of damage. The performance of the damaged truss-cored laminates therefore becomes similar to the foam-cored composite which belongs to the class of bending dominated structures [2].

The present study also reveals contradictory requirements on the material properties with respect to the beam performance during the different stages of loading. The final design must be set on the priority assessment for behavior during the initial loading and the damage recovery stage. All these effects place limits on the extent to which the truss-core panels can be formed prior to service and also affects their sensitivity to damage during service.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

An FEM study was conducted to evaluate the compressive stiffness of a beam which was damaged by previous compressive loading over the plastic buckling limit. The evolution of the stiffness with level of the initial damage has been analyzed. An analytical approximation was developed based on the FEM results and applied to an example of the truss core. The conclusions of the study are:
                        
                           •
                           Plasticity generally increases the beam deflection but materials with low yield stress and high hardening rate helps to minimize its effect.

The material properties influence predominantly the elastic relaxation after the initial loading and determine the amount of residual damage in the buckled beam. Materials with high yield stress and hardening rate minimize the amount of residual damage.

The stiffness of the beam decreases rapidly with the initial damage. The percentage of stiffness decrease is an order of magnitude higher compared to the percentage of initial damage. For example a beam with aspect ratio about 1/12 needs 3% of initial damage to decrease the stiffness by 50%.

The proposed analytical model predicts the stiffness of the damaged beam with an error less than 10% within its interval of validity (initial axial damage <10%).

The proposed model is able to predict the stiffness degradation of damaged truss core with an error less than 15%.

The proposed model is able to fulfill the need for the simple tool for prediction of the properties of damaged beam structures. It can be further extended for the different boundary conditions or the different cross-section geometry however its application range should be kept close to the small deformation limit due to its apparent simplicity.
