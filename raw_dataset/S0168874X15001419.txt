                  Finite element (FE) computations have been performed to analyze the thermo-chemo-mechanical behavior of SiC-based refractory parts in linings used in waste-to-energy plants. These parts are in contact on one side with smoke and ashes at high temperature, and on the other side with the pressurized vapor pipe. Three multi-layered lining designs have been studied: two with tiles and one with a concrete panel. A coupled model taking into account the transport of dioxygen in the gas through the porosity, the reaction of dioxygen in contact with silicon carbide particles and the formation of solid components gradually clogging the pores, has been implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS

                     . These phenomena affect the mass diffusion rate of dioxygen through the refractory layer and induce a macroscopic swelling of the material. The analysis of the numerical results allows for a better understanding of the influence of the lining design and the nature of the ceramics on the lifespan of such refractory parts.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Optimizing the design of multi-layered linings used in furnaces, stoves, kilns, ovens, in plants dealing with the manufacturing of metal, cement, ceramic, glass products, chemical and petroleum products or plants generating energy from waste or biomass is a great challenge. These linings must withstand to high process temperature, abrasive wear by hot liquid and solid particles, and aggressive chemical environment (hot gases, acid or basic gases, liquids and solids in movement). Their optimization is required for sustainable development of the manufacturing process and also for enhancing the safety, extending the lifespan of the industrial tools and reducing the costs.

Today, numerical computations are already performed on such structures. But even the thermomechanical models accounting for damage and creep, do not permit to predict well the stress and strain states in-service – except the first heating of the structure – as they are not able to simulate the complex microstructure change of the refractory ceramics (usually called refractories) and their consequences. Thus, one main difficulty to overcome is to develop mechanical behavior that are strongly dependant on the environment conditions (i.e. oxydation, corrosion, etc.).

The first goal of the paper is to demonstrate that the development of numerical tools capable to describe the diffusion of mass, the heat transfer, the oxidation mechanisms and the mechanical behavior will permit a better understanding of the degradation process of the material in the linings.

Silicon carbide (SiC)-based refractories are well known for their high resistance to corrosion, thermal shock and abrasion at high temperature [1,2]. Because of their good thermal conductivity they are often used in municipal waste incinerators to ensure a good heat recovery by the metallic waterwall tubes they have to protect against aggressive gas. In such plants, the flame temperature reaches up to 1200°C in the combustion chamber at the bottom level, while the waterwall temperature is approximately equal to 250°C. Around 17m higher at the top of the chamber, due to cooling the temperature of smoke and ashes is close to 500°C.

As the incineration of domestic and industrial waste is a continuous process, extending the lifetime of the protective refractory layer in the combustion chamber of the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant facilities is one option to limit the maintenance operations. Currently the lifetime of the lining is several years with one or two maintenance operations per year.

Observations made on worn parts of the refractory layer of the lining revealed different types of degradation of the material and parts of the refractory layer (e.g. tiles). These degradations reduce the efficiency of the protection again hot smoke and ashes with the consequence that the waterwall tubes can be corroded. As shown by Prigent [3], at the microstructural scale of the refractory several corrosion mechanisms take place over time. For example, post-mortem analysis on worn SiC-based tiles [4] has shown that molten salts react with SiC aggregates and matrix phases and form para-wollastonite around SiC grains and porosity near the zone close to the hot face of refractory tiles. Other phases such as cristobalite and microline are also formed down to the core of refractories. At the macroscopic scale cracks and rupture are common degradation that can be observed in the refractory layer of the lining. They result from excessive stresses induced by the progressive swelling of the material during the use. These degradations depend both on the material and the design of the lining. Fig. 1
                      illustrates the deformation of SiC-based tiles in the refractory lining parts that has occurred in-service.

The environmental conditions in the combustion chamber are not well known. Indeed, the nature of the chemical components of smoke and ashes depends on the waste burnt and the incinerator process. Moreover, the temperature field is strongly influenced by the incinerator management, the refractory lining design and the depth of the layer of ashes deposited on the hot face. Consequently different mechanisms of corrosion may be involved in the chemical degradation of the SiC-based refractory: chemical reactions between phases present in the initial composition of the material, chemical reactions between phases of the material and phases coming from the smoke and ashes. These reactions occur when phases in contact are not in chemical equilibrium. They strongly depend on the level of temperature and the transport conditions of the initial and produced species. The local mass change resulting from the disappearance of initial compounds and the deposition of new compounds explains the change in porosity and the macroscopic deformation. Porosity change and macroscopic deformation depends on the swelling and mechanical constraints at the local scale (i.e. the microstructure) and at the macroscopic scale (anchors design, thermal expansion, joint thickness, etc.).

These remarks show that thermomechanical phenomena and corrosion cannot be analyzed independently to fulfill the degradation observed. One way to study such degradation mechanisms consists in doing a multi-physical coupling analysis as already proposed in previous studies [5,6]. Such an analysis helps in selecting all phenomena involved, evaluating their importance and their interactions to finally select the main phenomena to model from a conceptual point of view.

In this paper, a multi-physics numerical model is developed in order to study the effect of lining design on the macroscopic deformation of the refractory layer induced by its corrosion (limited herein to oxidation). Currently, the level of knowledge and the data available do not allow the development of a highly complex model which takes into account all the mechanisms mentioned by Prigent [3]. Hereafter, attention is exclusively focused on the oxidation of SiC-based refractory. This choice is justified by the fact that this phenomenon is the first step in the degradation process of such linings and often participates substantially in the degradation of SiC-based refractory concrete structures [7].

The proposed thermo-chemo-mechanical model is built in the classical framework of irreversible thermodynamics of open continuous reactive media [8]. It takes into account a reactive diffusion of dioxygen present in the gas flowing through the porosity of the refractory layer. The formation of solid silica (SiO2) deposits gradually clogs the porosity. It leads to a reduction of the gas diffusion and to the development of a chemical strain that adds to the classical mechanical and thermal strains. The constitutive equations describing the complex material behavior have already been validated by comparison with experimental results on a reference case [9].

The model is shortly summarized in the first section and identified for two refractory materials. The implementation of this model in the finite element (FE) software ABAQUS ® [10] and the numerical method applied for solving the coupled partial differential equations are briefly detailed in the next section. The following section is dedicated to the analyses of the results of the simulations of the long-term behavior of the protective refractory layer (a one-year in-service without maintenance) in order to check the ability of such models to provide an assistance for the refractory lining design.

To reach this second goal of the paper, three lining designs representative of those already used in WTE have been studied. In two linings (denoted A and B, respectively) the refractory layer consists of an assembly of tiles (denoted A
                     
                        t
                      and B
                     
                        t
                     , respectively). These tiles are manufactured in refractory plants; first cast by pressing the mix in a mold and sintered at high temperature. Tile A
                     
                        t
                      is attached on the waterwall tubes with its handle, while tile B
                     
                        t
                      is tied on the top handle with a mortar. In the third lining design (denoted C) the refractory layer is made of an assembly of concrete panels (denoted C
                     
                        p
                     ). The panels are cast on-site and the first heating of the incinerator is managed to obtain the final properties of the material at high temperature. They are fixed to the metallic waterwall tubes by means of anchors.

For this three lining designs, computations have been carried out considering two SiC-based refractories supplied by Calderys a subsidiary of Imerys World Minerals under the brand names 
                        SF
                        60
                      and 
                        CV
                        85
                     . The aim is to compare the response of these six different configurations in order to better understand and distinguish the effects of geometry and material behavior on the long-term behavior of the lining.

The parameters for the multi-physical model described below have been identified for two types of SiC-based refractory which contain approximately 60wt% of SiC for the 
                           SF
                           60
                         and 85wt% of SiC for the 
                           CV
                           85
                        . Both materials have good resistance to corrosion and high temperatures.

The refractories are heterogeneous multi-phase concretes (also named castables) containing SiC grains with size ranging from several tenth micrometers to several millimeters. The grains are bonded with calcium-aluminate cement and form strong bonds in service at high temperature before the oxidation. The matrix phase is arbitrarily defined as the phase containing both fired cement and SiC aggregates with size below 
                           200
                           
                           μ
                           m
                        . The mass content of the matrix is 51.7% in refractory 
                           SF
                           60
                         and 53.6% in refractory 
                           CV
                           85
                        . The macroscopic porosity in both refractories is approximatively 16–17%. Mainly located in the matrix, it is open making easier the diffusion of oxygen through the bulk of the refractory layer.

It is not possible to model all the details of the complex material behavior of the heterogeneous microstructure in the numerical simulations of the refractory lining. Thus to build the macroscopic model describing an average behavior it is necessary to define a representative volume element (RVE). This RVE must be large enough to give a meaning to the definition of the average behavior and properties corresponding to those of an equivalent homogeneous material [11]. Consequently, one has to keep in mind that the model will not be able to describe accurately the evolution of the state at each point of the microstructure inside the RVE.

To build the thermo-chemo-mechanical model, the material has been defined as an open porous medium exchanging mass (i.e. gas), momentum and energy with the surrounding RVE. It accommodates a chemical reaction, hereafter the passive oxidation of SiC. Both the kinetics of the chemical reaction and the mass exchange have been considered slow enough to satisfy the thermodynamic assumptions. Only the main assumptions and equations of the model are summarized below. The complete multi-physics model has been presented in Ref. [9] where the material parameters have been identified for only one material.

Assuming local thermal equilibrium, hence same temperature in each species contained in the RVE, the heat equation for the whole medium reads:

Because of the high heat flux present in-service in the lining, the chemical heat source linked to the enthalpy of reaction is negligible, as well as the heat transported by the flowing gas through the RVE. Consequently, the temperature field, T, in the lining can be computed by solving the classical heat equation:

Note that for the engineering application studied here, the material parameters depend mostly on the temperature and in a secondary way on the microstructural change like porosity and phase change.

One can notice that during the oxidation a part of SiC disappears leading to an increase in porosity, whereas the deposit of formed silica SiO2 gradually clogs the pores. Consequently the porosity ϕ is defined as

The apparent delay may describe (i) the oxidation extent which is necessary to fill partially the porosity before the particles are pushed by the new swelling compounds and/or (ii) the shrinkage induced by the last stage of sintering of the matrix binder, which is not taken into account in the present work.

                         is detailed. The parameters of the oxidation kinetics have been identified thanks to thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) performed by Bahloul at 1000°C and 1200°C for 50h [16]. Assuming very fast flow of gas inside the powders the effect of gas diffusion can be neglected and the kinetics of oxidation in the small powder sample is representative of the local kinetics in the bulk refractory.

From the experimental curves, the constant rate k
                        
                           p
                         defined in Eq. (6) has been identified first for each temperature and then the activation energy E and the pre-exponential factor k
                        0. The data are reported in Table 1
                         for both refractories. The results from experiments and model show a good agreement (Fig. 2
                        ). However one has to keep in mind that the kinetics of SiC oxidation is substantially dependent on the size of the SiC aggregates. This point is deeply analyzed by Gallet-Doncieux et al. [17].

The identification of parameter β (Eq. (15)) requires to correlate the oxidation extent to the strain measured during dilatometry tests subjected to the same temperature history as the TGA tests. Assuming homogeneous oxidation in the dense samples, after the same duration, the oxidation extent should be the same as that of TGA powders. As the size of the dilatometry samples is small (9×9×15mm3), and there exists a high open porosity so that the diffusion of gas is very fast this assumption is reasonable.

Isothermal dilatometry tests have been done by Bahloul at 1000°C and 1200°C [16]. Other results are presented in Ref. [17].

The chemical expansion due to SiC oxidation versus time is plotted in Fig. 3
                        . Fig. 4
                         shows the correlation between the chemical strain, ε
                        
                           ch
                        , and the oxidation extent, ξ. The apparent non-linearity observed at the beginning of the curve corresponds to an additional mechanisms of deformation induced by the last stage of sintering of the matrix binder. After a time delay which depends on testing temperature a linear relationship takes progressively place between ε
                        
                           ch
                         and ξ which is less sensitive to the temperature. The slope of the linear part of the curve corresponds to β. The identified values are reported in Table 1.

It is obvious that the proposed identification favors the identification of the asymptotic slope. In fact, after the heat treatment of tiles in the manufacturing process, the sintering of the material is finished so that this non-linearity is not observed.

                        . This is not the case for the panel, as a part of the sintering is carried out during the first heating of the lining. To make easier the comparison between the different lining designs, the associated strain (shrinkage) due to sintering has not been taken into account.

                           85

                           60
                        . These observations illustrate that different strategies can be adopted to design suitable refractories with low macroscopic swelling in service by favoring either a low chemical expansion or a slow oxidation kinetics (e.g. by controlling the permeability). When the chemical expansion cannot been avoided a good alternative consists in designing a material by slowing down the kinetics.

As indicated previously, for the concerned engineering application, some couplings between the different phenomena discussed previously and consequently the couplings between the different equations describing these physics are weak.

The thermal problem is uncoupled so that the temperature field can be computed independently under the assumption that the material parameters (
                           ρ
                           ,

                           ,
                           λ
                        ) do not depend on the microstructure change, V
                        
                           m
                        , but only on the temperature, T. This assumption is justified by the fact that it is not possible to perform accurate tests to measure the evolution of these parameters as a function of V
                        
                           m
                         because homogeneous oxidation in the sample to test cannot be obtained. Moreover in practice the variations of ρ, c
                        
                           p
                         and λ with V
                        
                           m
                         are limited and do not affect substantially the temperature profile in the refractory layer.

The field equations describing the transport of species involving the field variable, x
                        
                           i
                        , and those describing the oxidation of SiC involving the field variable, ξ, are strongly coupled by the mass balance and must be solved together. To achieve this computation step, the temperature field is a prescribed input. The porosity is updated at each increment of the computation step of the mass balance equation.

The momentum balance is uncoupled, so the mechanical problem is solved separately. The temperature and the extent of oxidation field variables are prescribed conditions for the mechanical computation and the strain and stress field variables are determined.

The numerical computations of the multi-layered linings have been performed with the finite element code ABAQUS

                        [10] in three successive steps using solvers with an implicit integration scheme:
                           
                              •
                              
                                 first step: solving the set of equations describing the heat transfer,


                                 second step: solving the set of equations describing the mass transfer and the local oxidation kinetics,


                                 third step: solving the set of equations describing the mechanical behavior.

The implementation of the constitutive equations has required to add some specific features of the proposed model to complete those already available in the material model library of ABAQUS ®. The reactive transport (Eq. (4)), including the oxidation extent rate (Eq. (5)), has been implemented in the finite element software ABAQUS ® thanks to the UMATHT subroutine which allows us to modify the energy balance. The oxidation extent has been introduced as a degree of freedom and the energy balance has been modified to compute the reactive mass transport. The chemical strain (Eq. (15)) has been implemented in ABAQUS ® via the UEXPAN subroutine which allows us to define special thermal strain and/or special additional strain thanks to user defined field options. To take into account the temperature and the oxidation extent as field input data in the mechanical simulation, the result from reactive mass transport computations has been transferred to another user defined field variable using a dedicated homemade routine.

The protective refractory layer is made of tiles or panels. The thickness of the refractory part is small (
                           ≈
                           60
                           
                           mm
                        ) allowing an easy heat recovery by the metallic waterwall system. The refractory coating is in contact with hot smoke and ashes on the hot face and with the waterwall tubes on the cold face in which the water vapor temperature has been set to 250°C. The temperature in the combustion chamber is equal to 1200°C at the bottom level in the combustion flame. The temperature of smoke and ashes has been set to 1050°C in the FE model.

Three geometries of lining have been studied: two tile-based refractory layers and a panel-based refractory lining already partially described in Section 1. The design of the linings is shown in Figs. 5–7
                        
                        
                        . Tiles A
                        
                           t
                         are placed on their handles whereas tiles B
                        
                           t
                         are tied only on the top handles with a mortar. The panels C
                        
                           p
                         are fixed on the waterwall system with anchors, regularly distributed. Taking advantage of the symmetries of the problem only the half part of one tile has been meshed. For the concrete panel, the smallest representative cell containing an anchor allowing to reproduce the periodic structure of one panel has been meshed.

For the thermal computations, convective heat flux is applied between the refractory layer and the smoke and ashes with a constant heat transfer coefficient, h
                        
                           cf
                        , as well as between the pipes and the water steam with a constant heat transfer coefficient, h
                        
                           hf
                        . In lining designs A and B, a thermal resistance of contact is introduced between the pipes and the tiles. It is estimated by the ratio of the thickness of the air layer, e
                        
                           a

                           a
                        . The convective heat transfer coefficients were identified by temperature measurements made in an industrial WTE incinerator on a lining design A. Several tiles have been equipped with thermocouples and the temperatures measured at different depths have been recorded over a long period [18]. The temperature variations in the refractory part remained low because the temperature fluctuations of smoke and ashes were rapid in comparison to the characteristic thermal time of the refractories. After a transition stage corresponding to the heating of the incinerator, a quasi-stationary temperature has been recorded in the tiles during the use. Change in the temperature profiles was slow. Only the temperature in the first millimeters near the hot face of the refractory layer was affected by local temperature fluctuations.

The average of the experimental temperature over a long period is plotted, see dots in Fig. 8
                        . Temperature profiles, resulting from steady-state thermal computations with material parameters defined in Table 1 and with identified convective heat transfer coefficients

For the reactive transport simulation, the initial partial pressure of dioxygen gas in the bulk of the lining is uniform and equal to that of dioxygen contained in air (P=0.21atm). Partial pressures of dioxygen gas are applied at the hot face and the cold face of the tile or panel. At the hot face, the partial pressure of dioxygen, P
                        
                           hf

                        , changes with time because of the corrosion of the metallic pipe. After a few months, field observations have shown that the waterwall pipes are fully corroded on the side in contact with the refractories. So it was reasonable to fix the dioxygen partial pressure to a value close to zero, which maximized the dioxygen gas flow and thus favored slightly the oxidation process. This has allowed the estimate of upper bound values of ξ and

For the mechanical computations, the waterwall pipe is blocked in the three directions. A Coulomb contact is applied between the tile and the pipe for lining designs A and B with a friction coefficient of 0.2. The pipes are tied with the panel for lining design C. For lining design B, the anchor and the tile are pasted with mortar. Finally gravity force is applied to the linings. Only the temperature dependence of the elastic compliance tensor was taken into account as no experimental data are available for the influence of phase change and porosity variation. In practice, this effect is secondary and does only slightly affect the estimates of stress and strain tensors.

The material properties used for the numerical simulations have been identified previously and some data have been collected from the literature. The values are reported in Table 1.

                        . The thermal gradient in the thickness is quite similar in the two tiles. The small difference in the temperature range (14°C) is due to the hang up device which induces a higher thermal resistance in tile A
                        
                           t
                        . The substantial difference between the panel and the tiles (see also Table 2
                        ) is mainly due to the thermal resistance of static air between the tile and the pipe which increases the thermal resistance of the lining to about 50%.

To have a more detailed local view of the temperature at the hot face, Fig. 11
                         shows the temperature profiles along two vertical lines (V

                        1 is located at medium distance between fixing systems, while the continuous line V
                        2 passes facing the fixing device. It can be observed that a quasi-uniform temperature field exists for the panel (C

The oxidation extent in tiles obtained after the simulation of one-year in-service (in steady state) is shown in Figs. 12 and 13
                        
                        . For lining designs A and B, as oxidation is thermally activated, the oxidation extent field is heterogeneous and strongly linked to the thermal field. For the lining design C, the temperature in the panel being lower than the activation temperature, the oxidation extent predicted by the model is null. It may be somewhat different in reality because of the temperature fluctuations linked to waste burning. However, clearly the oxidation of the panel is much lower than that of the tiles.

                        2. The oxidized extent spot visualized in both designs in Figs. 12 and 13 are visible here. The peak of oxidation extent in tile A
                        
                           t
                         is more marked than that in tile B
                        
                           t
                        . Also it is observed that the design B exhibits a more homogeneous oxidation but with a higher average extent than design A. Table 3
                         summarizes the maximum values of the oxidation extent for the different configurations as well as the reduction in porosity.

Finally, four comments can be pointed out as follows:
                           
                              •
                              The oxidized area is a fine layer, located in the area where the temperature is high enough. The oxidized layer of tile B
                                 
                                    t
                                  is thicker than that for tile A
                                 
                                    t
                                 .

The oxidation extent is not uniform in the layer. A strong variation exists parallel to the hot face due to the thermal gradient in this plane (Figs. 12 and 13).

The lower the thermal conductivity of the refractory, the higher is the oxidation extent. A reduction of about 20% of the thermal conductivity leads to an increase in the maximum oxidation extent of about 60% for tile A
                                 
                                    t
                                  and 90% for tile B
                                 
                                    t
                                 .

After one-year in-service the porosity variation remains negligible with the result that both the thermal and mechanical properties are only affected by the local change in composition.

                         refractory is plotted. On can observe that the shape of the chemical extent curve is similar to those of the temperature curve, both decreasing with the depth. Remembering that the associated strains (ε

                        ) are proportional to ξ and T, respectively, it can be concluded that the localization of the “critical plane” is driven by the thickness of the oxidized area which is directly related to the temperature field.

In Fig. 18(b) the variations of the stress tensor components along the depth (axis H) are plotted. The normal stress is the stress component oriented in the thickness direction. It is low, close to zero. The vertical stress variation confirms the previous observations. The horizontal stress is parallel to the hot face. The curve is quite similar to that of the vertical stress with compressive stress magnitude slightly higher than that of the vertical stress and tensile stress magnitude close to that of the vertical stress.

The variation with depth of the spherical part of the stress tensor,

                           =

                           )
                        , clearly shows that there exists a biaxial tensile stress area surrounded by a biaxial compression stress area. So, the critical tensile stress state is located in the depth and its magnitude may favor the formation of microvoid and microcracks oriented perpendicular to the hot face. It is interesting to note that the stress field is strongly different for tile B
                        
                           t
                        , while the oxidation extent field is quite similar. This demonstrates that the final stress field resulting from a complex combination of thermal expansion, oxidation swelling and mechanical constrains cannot be estimated only from one particular point of view, namely a mechanical, a thermal or a chemical point of view.

                         shows the healthy and worn shapes of real tiles used in an incinerator. The material of the tile is slightly different than those identified in this study. After long months of use (unfortunately not known), the worn tile has progressively undergone an increasing bending solicitation. Due to the residual chemical expansion on the corroded layer near the hot face, after cooling residual macroscopic strain exists with self-equilibrium stresses. Consequently triaxial tensile stresses exist in the oxidized layer near the hot face after cooling. Fig. 20

                         and for the two refractories studied, after one year of steady state temperature field. As it can be seen, the whole curvature of the worn tile is well reproduced by the model. However a quantitative comparison of in situ measurements of the shape variation of worn tile and the predicted shape variation with the numerical model is not possible yet because the time spent by the real worn tile in the plant is unknown, the material of the real tile differs from those identified and finally the swelling induced by the corrosion is not quantitatively the same as oxidation. However, the displacement predicted by the model is of the same order of magnitude (i.e. 2mm) than that measured on the tiles (between 5 and 10mm). This acceptable result confirms that the essential phenomena are well reproduced. Despite of the current limits of the numerical model, the analysis of the first results gives interesting qualitative information and helped to better understand the combined effect of the thermal gradient and the oxidation and to optimize the geometry of the refractory parts.

@&#SUMMARY@&#

A thermo-chemo-mechanical model has been developed for the analysis of stresses and strains occurring in refractory linings which are subjected to both thermomechanical and thermochemical transitions. In addition to the classical thermomechanical results, this macroscopic model allows us to estimate the average extent of oxidation of SiC aggregates contained in the refractory and its major effects, namely the decrease in porosity and the swelling induced by the oxidation.

Simulations of long-term steady-state service of three designs from waste-to-energy plant have been performed. Two refractory layer designs correspond to tiles having different geometries and fastening systems. The third design is representative of a concrete panel. Comparisons have been made of the thermo-chemo-mechanical responses obtained for these designs considering two SiC-based refractories. The numerical results reproduce qualitatively the swelling of post-mortem bricks and the localization of stress concentration that may lead to potential failure of the refractory parts. They allow us to highlight the effect of design in relation with the material properties.

The analysis was more focused on the tiles as it was shown that no oxidation of SiC has been predicted in the panel. But other problems must be addressed in the future for this recent design as the sintering step of the panel made on-site introduces an additional deformation mechanism and modifies the mechanical behavior. As no sufficient feedback of the tests of the panel design existed (temperature measurements, presence or not of an air film after a certain time of use, etc.) these points were outside the scope of this study and have not been addressed.

These numerical computations have permitted to better understand the role played by geometry and material. The geometry has a major influence on the local heterogeneity of the temperature field close to the hang-up devices, while the thermal resistance (contact, convection, etc.) influences the global shape of the temperature field. The oxidation extent is driven by both the temperature and time. So, the localization of the oxidation is dictated by the geometry while the material properties, like porosity, grain size, etc. are factors managing the global kinetics of oxidation and the magnitude of the associated swelling. The mechanical stresses result in the combination of the behavior law and part׳s geometry and associated hang-up devices. So, the final damage of the lining (cracks, rupture, etc.) is mainly driven on one hand by the localization (temperature field, oxidation extent field, and mechanical constraints) and on the other hand by the combination of materials (reactions, kinetics) and geometry (temperature).

It is essential to moderate the previous conclusions by underlining that the proposed computation strategy made in three successive steps (i.e. thermal, chemical, and mechanical) does not allow us to analyze the effect of oxidation and the resulting change in the thermal conductivity on the temperature distribution. More generally, the computation scheme has not permitted us to take into account all the couplings between the different phenomena and in particular the changes in certain material parameters (with the porosity for example). This point can be solved by adopting a fully coupled computations and taking into account material parameters evolution. It constitutes a consequent refinement of the proposed model as it needs to collect a lot of additional experimental data and the development of a new dedicated subroutine. The authors think that it may not significantly change for example the temperature field in comparison with the geometry effect (i.e. localization).

It is interesting to note that this model has been implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS ®[10] by using strain partition to account for the different mechanisms of deformation and thanks to a UMATHT subroutine for the thermochemical part. Thus, the extension to non-linear mechanical behavior (plasticity, damage, etc.) is trivial by using the material library of ABAQUS ®[10]. Conversely, the implementation of more complex corrosion mechanisms requires further development of the in-house UMATHT subroutine.
