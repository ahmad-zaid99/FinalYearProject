Muscle load

Assessment methods

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  This article presents a comparative analysis of easy-to-use methods for assessing musculoskeletal load and the risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders. In all such methods, assessment of load consists in defining input data, the procedure and the system of assessment. This article shows what assessment steps the methods have in common; it also shows how those methods differ in each step. In addition, the methods are grouped according to their characteristic features. The conclusion is that the concepts of assessing risk in different methods can be used to develop solutions leading to a comprehensive method appropriate for all work tasks and all parts of the body. However, studies are necessary to verify the accepted premises and to introduce some standardization that would make consolidation possible.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are among the most serious consequences of improper work-related musculoskeletal load (Hoogendoorn et al., 2002; Van Niewenhuyse et al., 2006; Joksimovic et al., 2002; Bosch et al., 2007; van der Windt et al., 2000). Symptoms of MSDs are defined as pain in one or more regions of the body. Accumulated minor injuries that result from repeated long-term work-related load can be considered the main cause of MSDs (NRC, 2001).

Research confirms a relationship between musculoskeletal load expressed as a function of parameters that describe posture, force and time sequences, and the incidence of MSDs (Van Nieuwenhuyse et al., 2006). This means that a suitable work load can reduce the risk of developing MSDs. Biomechanical factors − posture and exerted force (so-called external force) − are the most important documented factors related to the workstation. Time sequences of load are important, too (Buckle and Deverux, 2002). That is why it is so important to correctly assess that load on the basis of biomechanical factors and the methods this can be done with.

Methods assess either the work load at the workstation or the reaction of the worker's body to that work load. This means that methods can be divided into those assessing either external or internal load. External load results in internal load. The consequences of internal load depend on workers' personal characteristics, so the reaction to external load can differ according to personal capacity. Thus, the same external load can be either a case of low or high internal load. Heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature indicate internal load (Hjortskov et al., 2004; Finsen et al., 2001; Krantz et al., 2004), so does muscle tension assessed with surface electromyography (EMG) (Village et al., 2005; Bartuzi et al., 2007). However, the former measures indicate general load, the latter local. Changes in the value of those indicators that are related to the duration of load are a measure of muscle fatigue resulting from work tasks. Those indicators reflect both work-related load and the worker's personal traits, such as capacity, which is influenced by the general health, age and gender (Farina and Mesin, 2005; Bartuzi et al., 2010; Larsson et al., 2006). That makes it difficult to establish general criteria that would determine if a given task is a risk for MSDs.

Procedures for assessing external load generally use parameters of the posture of the individual parts of the body, the force the worker exerts and time sequences of load. In repetitive work, the length of the cycle, the length of its individual phases, the relative force of each of those phases and their number are relevant, as is information on posture. Sometimes anthropometric factors play a part, too.

Most methods for assessing external load differ in both what they are used for and how they are used, including purposes other than occupational risk assessment (Dockrell et al., 2012). Some can be used for a general assessment, whereas other ones can also focus on assessing load or the risk for pain complaints in specific areas, such as the low back or the wrists. Those methods differ in the way they define input data, they differ in whether they assess load with absolute indicators and whether they assess risk for MSDs by comparing the value of an indicator of load with the limit values of risk zones. Methods also differ in their complexity. However, according to van der Beek et al. (2005), simple methods for assessing the low back might be as effective as more complex ones.

It is important to realize that assessing a workstation with more than one method often produces ambiguous results (van der Beek et al., 2005; Kee and Karwowski, 2007; Russell et al., 2007). The differences in the results can result from the variety in the degrees of precision of input data, in the systems of assessment and in the criteria of risk assessment.

Methods are usually dedicated to a restricted type of work task and a restricted body area. Because different methods focus on different work tasks, comparing work load at different workstations can be considered dubious. To conduct a comprehensive assessment, it is necessary to use a combination of methods. When considering repetitive tasks of the upper limbs, it should be noted that whereas the upper limbs are loaded with repetitive tasks, the back and the lower limbs are loaded at the same time, too. So, a total assessment requires at least two methods. Considering the increasing awareness and protection of the worker, it should be expected that workers will be involved in various work tasks. Rotation of workstations is increasingly common. Hence, methods that assess risk comprehensively, irrespective of the type of task are necessary.

Comprehensive assessment of the external load and the risk for developing MSDs should consider (a) the worker's whole body, (b) the load of the upper limbs, the lower limbs and the low back irrespective of the worker's posture and (c) a variety of work tasks with respect to body posture, the type and value of force exerted in individual phases of the cycle and the frequency of repetitions of the work tasks.

A method for a comprehensive assessment of both the whole body and its individual segments with consideration for a variety of work tasks could be based on already available solutions. It could also benefit from combining a few methods. Therefore, it is important to analyse methods that are relevant for assessing work load and the risk for developing MSDs. That means, it would be interesting to review existing methods with respect to the similarities and differences in individual stages of the assessment procedure and in the way they are used at specific types of workstations. As these methods are so diverse, their critical review can provide a synthesis useful in developing a concept of a method that is based on them but is more versatile. That review can be a starting point for a new cumulative risk assessment method. It can also help to verify the thesis that the present methods of work load assessment constitute a basis for developing a versatile method.

The aim of this study is to compare the ways different methods define posture and force, and their systems of assessment in the context of the variety and ambiguity of the existing solutions to select solutions that would help develop a versatile method for a comprehensive assessment of work load.

Methods that assess external load and have a properly described procedure and systems of defining and assessing input data were selected for analysis and comparison. It was also important for them either to be pen-and-paper methods or to use common computer programs for simple calculations. The following ones were selected:
                        
                           •
                           KIM (Key Item Method) (Steinberg et al., 2006);

the revised NIOSH lifting equation (EN 1005-2:2008);

OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) (Karhu et al., 1977, 1981);

LUBA (Postural Loading on the Upper Body Assessment) (Kee and Karwowski, 2001);

OCRA (Occupational Repetitive Actions) (Occhipinti, 1998; EN 1005-5:2007);

SI (Strain Index) (Moore and Garg, 1995);

ULRA (Upper Limb Risk Assessment) (Roman-Liu, 2007);

the procedure in Standard EN 1005-4:2005.

RULA – Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (McAtmney and Corlett, 1993);

REBA – Rapid Entire Body Assessment (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000).

Those methods differ in their stages of assessment. They also differ in the body area they assess and the types of work tasks they focus on. They can be grouped and analysed with reference to their characteristic features (Fig. 1
                     ).

The methods selected for analysis vary in the area of the body they assess. Some methods assess the load of the back, the upper and the lower limbs independently of each other, whereas others provide a total assessment. Still others assess the upper limbs or the upper part of the body only (Fig. 2
                        ).

OWAS, RULA (McAtmney and Corlett, 1993) and REBA, the modified version of RULA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000) are the most common methods for assessing the load of the whole body. They make it possible to identify physical effort caused by posture, force, and static or repetitive load. RULA and REBA differ in the values of the codes assigned to body postures and in the system of assessing risk. LUBA assesses posture-related load of the upper part of the body. It considers the hand, the arm, the neck and the back. The posture of a body part is classified on the basis of the range of angles in the joints. The other methods, e.g., OCRA, SI and ULRA, focus on the upper limb only.

Methods also focus on different work tasks. Repetitive work (Kilbom, 1994) leads to an increased risk for developing MSDs. OCRA (Occupational Repetitive Actions) (Occhipinti, 1998), SI (Strain Index) (Moore and Garg, 1995) and ULRA (Upper Limb Risk Assessment) (Roman-Liu, 2007) assess load and risk related to repetitive tasks that involve the upper limbs. In ULRA (Roman-Liu, 2007), the load of the upper limb is expressed with the value of the Repetitive Task Indicator (RTI). RTI is computed with an equation that considers the length of the cycle, the length of individual phases of the cycle and the relative force of each phase of the cycle. Force diversity is reflected both in the type of force in each phase of the cycle and in its relative value in each phase, considering upper limb posture (Roman-Liu and Tokarski, 2005). The posture of the upper limb is defined with the values of seven angles, accepting the model of the upper limb as three rigid elements (the hand is one rigid element). It is possible to define any posture of the arm, forearm and hand with those seven angles. ULRA can also assess non-repetitive tasks.

In OCRA, assessment is based on the recommended number of reference technical actions. That number is a product of multipliers describing repetitiveness of tasks, postures of the upper limbs, exerted forces and cycle times. Those multipliers identify load and the risk for developing MSDs. This method considers the movement of the forearm only, thus considerably limiting comprehensive assessment.

SI (Moore and Garg, 1995) requires measuring or estimating six variables: intensity of exertion, duration of exertion, efforts per minute, hand/wrist posture, speed of work and duration of task per work shift. Each variable is assigned a rating and a corresponding multiplier. Three variables (intensity of exertion, hand/wrist posture and speed of work) are assessed qualitatively only. SI is computed as a product of those ratings. An increased value of SI indicates risk for developing MSDs. It is important, though, that SI was developed to predict disorders in the muscles and tendons in the area of the wrist, especially the carpal tunnel syndrome.

Static load, i.e., load sustaining the same posture for a long time, is another type of physical load related to increased risk for developing MSDs. Both OWAS and the method described in Standard EN 1005-4:2005 are used in assessing static load. The procedure in Standard EN 1005-4:2005 considers separately the location and the movements of individual segments of the body in relation to the ranges of movement. Risk assessment combines assessing the posture of a body segment in a defined range and assessing the repetition of movements. The frequency of repetitions is classified in three zones: static posture, low frequency of repetitions (<2/min) and high frequency of repetitions (≥2/min).

Manual handling is another type of task that methods especially consider. KIM (Key Item Method) (Steinberg et al., 2006), the revised NIOSH lifting equation (Standard EN1005-2:2008) and OWAS (Ovako Working Posture Analysis System) (Karhu et al., 1977, 1981) are dedicated to assessing load resulting from manual handling.

The revised NIOSH lifting equation and KIM are limited by the fact that they can only be used for work tasks that involve lifting (NIOSH), or lifting and pushing (KIM). OWAS can be used to assess load during other work tasks, too.

Numerous studies confirm the relationship between the risk for developing MSDs and awkward postures. Work in a bent or twisted posture for over 2 h a day is a strong risk factor (Van Nieuwenhuyse et al., 2006). Flexion and rotation of the torso by over 30° and sustaining that posture for over 15 min increases the risk compared to sustaining it for under 5 min (Hoogendoorn et al., 2002). Ariëns et al. (2002) found an increase in the risk for developing complaints in the neck and shoulder during neck rotation. Those results indicate the importance of body posture at work in the total load and the development of MSDs.

To define posture, methods for assessing external load usually rely on a very simple model of the body, which reflects the posture of the upper limbs, the back and the lower limbs. Different methods define posture in different ways. Some define body posture with values, others with ranges of values, which are then assigned codes, multipliers or scores. Fig. 3
                            illustrates the different ways different methods define input data.

OWAS, KIM and partly NIOSH define body posture qualitatively. OWAS assigns codes that distinguish qualitatively if a posture is neutral or not. It considers separately the posture of the back, the arms and the legs. In KIM (Steinberg et al., 2006), one of four postures is selected. The revised NIOSH lifting equation defines body posture indirectly through the initial location of the lifted object and its displacement. The vertical distance between the hands and the floor defines the location of the object. In the horizontal plane, the distance between the hands and the body axis is defined. The absolute difference between the vertical height at the origin and at the destination of the lift, i.e., the vertical travel distance of the object, is considered, too. The defined angle of twisting is another parameter that affects posture.

Other methods define posture quantitatively with values or ranges of values; however, methods differ in what body parts and ranges of angles they consider. Posture is defined by flexion/extension (movement in the sagittal plane), lateral bending (in the frontal plane) and rotation (in the transverse plane). REBA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000), RULA (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), LUBA (Kee and Karwowski, 2001) and the procedure in Standard EN 1005-4:2005 assess quantitatively the posture of the back, in relation to the low back and the neck. Table 1
                            lists how different methods define posture of the low back and the neck.

All those methods consider movement in the sagittal plane. Standard EN 1005-4:2005, REBA and LUBA define both flexion and extension in the sagittal plane. RULA and OWAS consider flexion only. Standard EN1005-4:2005 and LUBA consider movement in the frontal plane, too. RULA and REBA consider movement other than in the sagittal plane quantitatively only. It is only RULA and REBA that identify neutral posture (0° deviation). The other methods consider ranges of movement. However, the ranges of movement are mostly the same. LUBA (Kee and Karwowski, 2001) defines the posture of the back most precisely; it divides the range of movements into the largest number of zones. The ranges of angles depend on whether a person is sitting or standing.

RULA (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), REBA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000), Standard EN 1005-4:2005, LUBA (Kee and Karwowski, 2001), OCRA (Occhipinti, 1998) and ULRA (Roman-Liu, 2007) also define the posture of the upper limb (Table 2
                           ).

ULRA defines the posture of the upper limb with the values of seven angles. As the model of the upper limb has three rigid elements, it is possible to define any posture of the arm, the forearm and the hand. LUBA also considers the posture of the shoulder, the elbow and the wrist joints. Like ULRA, this method considers the seven angles that define the posture of the upper limb. However, it considers ranges of values, not values like ULRA.

Whereas RULA and REBA consider the same ranges of values for the arm and the forearm, they differ in the values for the wrist. The difference in those values applies to the wrist in the neutral posture. RULA, which has three ranges of values, considers that posture.

The procedure in Standard EN 1005-4:2005 distinguishes four ranges of the movement of the arm. The angles are the same for arm flexion (the sagittal plane) and abduction (the frontal plane). The procedure does not consider the movement of the forearm in relation to the arm. In OCRA, because there is no data, the posture of the shoulder “cannot be included in the OCRA index computation procedure” (Standard EN1005-5; p. 15). Therefore, the OCRA index considers ranges related to the posture of the forearm and hand only. Each of the four distinguished angles has two ranges.

RULA and REBA are the only methods that consider the posture of the lower limbs quantitatively. They look at the angle of flexion in the knee, which has two ranges: 30°–60° and over 60°. OWAS assesses the posture of the lower limbs qualitatively. It considers sitting, standing with one or both knees straight or bent, kneeling with one or both knees touching the ground and walking. In KIM, the choice applies to what is considered the posture of the whole body and it is only in that meaning that KIM considers the posture of the lower limbs. The other methods do not consider them.

Most methods this paper discusses consider forces as absolute values. Only ULRA considers forces to be relative. OWAS (Karhu et al., 1977, 1981), RULA (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), REBA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000), ULRA (Roman-Liu, 2007) and OCRA (Occhipinti, 1998) consider force exerted during work tasks. OWAS classifies force in three ranges: external force under 10 kG, 10–20 kG and over 20 kG. REBA classifies force as under 5 kg, 5–10 kg and over 10 kg. For RULA, force is 2 kg or less, 2–10 kg or over 10 kg. It also considers whether force is repetitive, static or exerted rapidly. OCRA uses the Borg scale to describe force (in a known population of workers) or it relates the exerted force to the maximal force for the whole population of workers (i.e., an unknown population of workers).

ULRA considers not only the value of force but also its type. The basic types of force activities reflect typical, most common work tasks. Manipulation tasks, such as a hand grip and a pinch, are distinguished. Force capabilities and maximal force change with a change in the posture of the upper limb. Those changes, however, differ depending on the force activity (Roman-Liu and Tokarski, 2005).

To analyse musculoskeletal load in each posture, it is important to consider the time factor, i.e., the frequency of repetitions or the time sequences of each task. Some methods consider this factor qualitatively by indicating if work is static or repetitive. RULA and REBA are examples: in their overall risk assessment, they consider if the load is static (i.e., a posture is sustained for over 1 min) or if work repetitive (i.e., a task is repeated at least four times per minute). Fig. 4
                            illustrates how different methods include posture, forces and time sequences in their assessment procedures.

ULRA introduces the most precise definition of time sequences. It considers tasks with various numbers of cycle phases and various duration of those phases with different force levels. It is accepted that during each phase there is load, i.e., different external force and different upper limb posture.

The methods poorly consider multitasks. The revised NIOSH lifting equation and OCRA take into account the duration of manual handling or repetitive tasks during a work shift. However, they do not consider the type or load of a possible other task. RULA and REBA base their assessment on a given posture, which can be repeated. However, those methods do not consider multitasks. Work organization understood as time sequences assigned to different tasks and work breaks are not considered. ULRA considers general tasks. A time schedule lists all tasks with an assigned duration of each task.

Input data are processed in accordance with a given method. The ranges of input data are converted into codes, multipliers or scores, which are in turn converted with simple equations or tables. If values are the input data, parameters that they define are the independent variables in the equation that describes load (ULRA). An equation with multipliers or simple equations that compute a score are other options. Fig. 5
                         illustrates assessment systems in different methods.

OCRA and the revised NIOSH lifting equation base their assessment on equations, which consider multipliers referring to posture, force and the time sequences of a task. Those methods express the computed recommended weight limit (NIOSH) or the recommended number of reference technical actions (OCRA) calculated as a product of multipliers that characterize the other load factors. In the revised NIOSH lifting equation, risk is assessed on the basis of the quotient of the actual value of the lifted load and the computed value of the recommended load. OCRA is an indicator that is the quotient of the frequency of repetitions (the reference frequency) and the recommended number of reference technical actions per minute. Multipliers are independent variables in SI, too. Computations produce a value that express upper limb load.

In LUBA and KIM, the result of an assessment is partly based on simple equations, in which the scores assigned to postures are the variables. OWAS, RULA and REBA use tables to group combinations of data, which describe postures of individual body parts and the external force, into assessment categories for workstations. Each combination is assigned a code, which a table then converts into one digit that expresses the assessment category of a workstation.

The last stage consists in assessing risk based on an assessment of musculoskeletal load computed in accordance with a given method. It is possible to assess the risk for developing MSDs only if the result of the assessment of load is compared with the criteria that express the level of risk. Some methods, as their final result, present the risk of developing MSDs only (OCRA, ULRA, Standard EN 1005-4; KIM with actions, SI, revised NIOSH lifting equation). Other methods indicate priorities necessary to lower the load and risk of developing MSDs (LUBA, REBA, RULA, OWAS). By pointing to further actions, it is possible to sustain current load or to investigate it further and consider corrective actions. However, this can also indicate an immediate need to carry out further measurements and to introduce possible or immediate changes.

Methods differ in the number of assessment levels. The revised NIOSH equation, OCRA and the procedure in Standard EN1005-4:2005 use three-level systems of risk assessment; OWAS, RULA and LUBA use four levels; whereas REBA uses a five-level system of assessment.

In risk assessment, indicators of external load and levels, which correspond to low, medium or high risk for developing MSDs, are important. However, also important are the simplicity, utility, reliability and validity a method offers. Intra- and inter-observer repeatability are important components of reliability. Some studies aimed at determining intra- and inter-observer repeatability: different methods produced different results. For example, OWAS has good intra- (de Bruijn et al., 1998; Kee and Karwowski, 2007) and inter-observer (Kahru et al., 1977; de Bruijn et al., 1998; Kivi and Mattila, 1991; Mattila et al., 1993) repeatability. Inter-observer repeatability of REBA was shown to be moderate or high for postures of the lower limbs and the trunk but low for the upper limbs (Janowitz et al., 2006). RULA's inter-observer repeatability was reported to be moderate (Burt and Punnett, 1999).

The validity of a method can be assessed by comparing it with a more valid one or by assessing how well its risk estimates are associated with MSDs (Takala et al., 2010). The methods presented here have different or, more often, undetermined validity.

Postural load of workers' back, lower limbs and lifting activities, measured with OWAS was associated with the occurrence of back pain (Burdorf et al., 1991). REBA observations corresponded moderately with those of OWAS, although the former classified more postures as having a higher level of risk (Burdorf et al., 1991). RULA's posture scores and the intensity scores of the Strain Index corresponded poorly (Drinkaus et al., 2003). So did OCRA and the Strain Index (Jones and Kumar, 2007). The correspondence of RULA with OWAS and REBA was found to be moderate (Kee and Karwowski, 2007). Higher values of load indicators were associated with MSDs when OCRA (Occhipinti and Colombini, 2007) and RULA were considered (Shuval and Donchin, 2005). Also in laboratory studies, higher musculoskeletal load was associated with increased discomfort when RULA was used (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993; Fountain, 2003). Evaluations made with REBA, the Strain Index and OCRA were similar when risk levels were considered (Jones and Kumar, 2007).

In addition to the issues of inter-reliability, intra-reliability and validity, the simplicity/complexity of the method is also important. There is no generally accepted procedure for evaluating methods for their simplicity or complexity. However, it can be assumed that the simplicity of a method depends fundamentally on how simple input data are. Two aspects are crucial in considering input data referring to posture: firstly, how many angles define the posture; secondly, how accurate input data are. For example, upper limb posture can be defined with seven angles (ULRA) or just as below or above shoulder level (OWAS). However, it can be also defined with angles in two planes, sagittal and frontal (RULA, REBA, Standard EN1005-4). Whether input data are accurate or not also depends on how angles are defined: as values or as ranges.

It can be supposed that the accuracy of input data increases with the number of angles that define posture and with narrow ranges of values. In this respect, ULRA and OCRA can be considered complex. So can LUBA, in data defining posture only.

Simplicity is closely related to the accuracy of assessment. Simpler methods might be less accurate. Therefore, a reliable method requires a balance between accuracy, complexity, cost and simplicity of use.

@&#DISCUSSION@&#

This article presents a comparative analysis of common methods for assessing musculoskeletal load and the risk for developing MSDs. The methods were selected on the basis of the criteria relevant in a complex assessment of musculoskeletal load, which depends on body posture, exerted forces and time. Therefore, only those methods that took into account the parameters those factors describe were considered. For the selection it was also meaningful, if the core element of assessment in the method was based on objective measures. Subjective methods based on qualitative assessment are usually less time consuming and applicable to a wide range of situations at work. However, their major problem is that workers' perceptions of exposure may be imprecise and biased by pain they might be experiencing at the moment, for example.

Assessment of an individual performing work tasks, was another aspect of the selection. Specific anthropometric measures in combination with the spatial design of the workstation define angles of the body. In the selected methods, the influence of those angles is a basis of load assessment.

Methods for assessing musculoskeletal load and the risk for developing MSDs based on direct measurements, e.g., electromyography, were excluded. Those methods are quantitative and highly accurate, but expensive due to the sophisticated equipment and time-consuming calibration, registration and analysis they require.

Selecting methods on the basis of all those criteria has its consequences; the comparison is limited by the body part and the type of work tasks the methods assess, and the definition of input data as values or ranges of values, and systems of assessing load.

Assessment methods share actions that make up a procedure; however, they differ in how each stage is carried out. Methods primarily differ in how they identify variables that describe posture, force and time sequences, but also in the way they assess work load and, in some cases, in how they determine the level of risk related to that load. Thus, different methods can produce different assessments of the same work tasks (van der Beek et al., 2005).

Methods generally tackle one type of task only. Multitasks can be analysed with OWAS and ULRA only. ULRA is generally suitable for repetitive tasks analysis. However, it can also be used for any type of task. In such a case, each task is considered and a time sequence is attributed to it. In this respect, it can be considered as a basis for a new comprehensive method.

In a comprehensive method, which might be considered as a reliable tool, input data and procedures for calculating load are crucial. Such pillars for a comprehensive method for assessing external load and risk can be based on solutions in the methods presented in this article. Whether a method is accurate depends on the accuracy of input data. In these methods, that accuracy depends on values, ranges of values or qualitative data. The results of most of the presented methods are based on ranges. So, ranges should be appropriate. However, the question arises as to how broad the ranges should be and how many angles should describe a posture of a given body area. ULRA and LUBA provide the most complex description of upper limb posture. Upper limb posture defined according to ULRA would make it possible to define any upper limb posture. However, it seems that if ranges of angles are accepted instead of values of angles, the same ranges which are proposed in LUBA will be adequately precise. In defining trunk posture, RULA (McAtamney and Corlett, 1993), REBA (Hignett and McAtamney, 2000), Standard EN 1005-4 and LUBA (Kee and Karwowski, 2001) all accept ranges of angles. The solutions in the methods discussed here suggest that the angles in sagittal, frontal and horizontal planes should describe the posture of the neck and the lumbar spine. The ranges of angles defining the low back and the posture of the neck in Standard EN1005-4 correspond in various respects with those of REBA, RULA and LUBA, and as such can be accepted as a solution in new method.

When force is considered, it can be defined as absolute or relative. However, the type of force is important, too (Roman-Liu and Tokarski, 2005). When considering the upper limb, ULRA considers different type of forces, whereas OCRA considers different grasps. Force exerted by the upper limbs influences lumbar spine load (Chaffin, 1997). That aspect needs to be considered too.

The new comprehensive method should be, however, supported by solutions present in other methods, too, e.g., by formulas expressing spine load as a function of posture and force located in the hands similar to those of Chaffin (1997). The solutions in the methods discussed here rely on simple equations. Supplementing those solutions with more sophisticated ones could make the new comprehensive method more precise.

In a method that considers all work activities, time needs to be assigned to each activity. ULRA uses such a solution. A detailed characteristic of tasks with assigned time sequences creates a basis for calculations in which the load of individual body parts is a function of variables describing posture, forces and time sequences. Such an equation should consider changes in activities and repeatability of tasks the way ULRA does, or use multipliers like OCRA and the revised NIOSH lifting equation.

The limitation of the presented methods lies in the fact that they assess external load: they consider only parameters related to the spatial and temporal aspect of the workstation. However, other factors, too, affect load and fatigue at work and thus the development of MSDs. Several sources indicate that beside biomechanical factors, psychosocial ones are among the main causes of the development of MSDs (Korhonen et al., 2003; Skov et al., 1996; Fredriksson et al., 2000; Joksimovic et al., 2002). In addition to factors directly related to workstations, there are other important personal factors: genetic and those related to the worker's habits and behaviour outside the working environment (van den Heuvel et al., 2005).

@&#CONCLUSION@&#

It is possible to say that the methods discussed in this article reflect concepts of assessing risk for developing MSDs. Those concepts can be used in developing solutions leading to a comprehensive method that could be used for all work tasks and all parts of the body. The development of such a method can be supported with solutions obtained with more sophisticated methods. A method like that would consider precise input data related to body posture, force and time sequences. Using a method that would help determine a worker's biomechanical load and the probability of developing MSDs irrespective of the work task could contribute to a decrease in the prevalence of MSDs. However, studies that would make it possible to verify the accepted premises are necessary, as is some standardization that would make consolidation possible.
