@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  An efficient computational method is developed for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials which are often found in civil, composite and biological engineering. Based on the parametric variational principle (PVP), a unified constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials is proposed to deal with the problem of numerical instability. The small-strain bi-modulus problem is transformed into a standard linear complementarity problem that can be solved easily by the classic Lemke׳s algorithm. By using the co-rotational approach, the local PVP formulation is combined with an existing co-rotational formulation and a new tangent stiffness matrix, including a parametric variable, is derived for geometrically nonlinear analysis. Traditional stress iteration is not required for calculation of the nodal internal force when the Newton–Raphson scheme or Arc-length method is employed to solve the material and geometric nonlinear problem. Convergence of the proposed algorithm is improved greatly in contrast to the traditionally iterative solution. Also, the proposed algorithm is used to simulate a unilateral contact behavior of staggered bio-composites and the effective elasticity modulus of composites is determined accurately.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

Some materials, such as concrete, polymer and composites, usually exhibit different mechanical responses in tension and compression in that they have different tensile and compressive moduli [1–3]. This kind of material is usually called bi-modulus material which has been reported in a lot of literature and monograph. For instance, a test shows that a certain granule concrete, made of quartzite and Portland cement, is a typical bi-modulus whose tensile modulus is

                      is close to eight at room temperature [4]. Similar phenomena were observed in a damaged brittle material containing micro-cracks [5], aged polycrystalline NiTi alloys [6] and some bio-materials composed of soft organisms and hard minerals [7].

Mechanical analysis of bi-modulus materials is out of the scope of classical elasticity theory in solid mechanics which assumes material has the same moduli in tension and compression [8,9]. A great error cannot be ignored as the classical elasticity theory is used to analyze the mechanical behavior of bi-modulus materials, especially when the value of

                      is far from 1. The new stress–strain relationships and elasticity theory were developed by some researchers for bi-modulus materials. Jones [10] and Vijayakumar and Rao [11] proposed different stress–strain relationships for composites with different stiffness in tension and compression. Subsequently, the stress–strain relationship of bi-modulus materials was simplified as a bilinear model as shown in 
                     Fig. 1, which plays an important role on the later analytical and numerical solutions [4]. Some analytical solutions of bi-modulus materials can be found [12,13], but they are limited to simple and regular structures such as beams and columns, which are subjected to idealized loads and constraints.

Numerical analysis based on the finite element method (FEM) is a useful way for the complicated engineering structures made of bi-modulus materials. Zhang and Wang proposed the finite element formulation for a planar bi-modulus structure with a circle hole and they pointed out that the convergence was poor when using traditional iterative schemes to solve the nonlinear equation [14]. To improve the convergence, Yang and Zhu proposed a smoothing technique, which can be applied to solve 2D static bi-modulus problem [15] and also 1D dynamic and inverse problems [16,17]. Although convergence of the algorithm is improved by the smoothing technique, it still depends on the determination of parameters in the smoothing function. He et al. discussed and revealed the reason why the traditional Newton–Raphson scheme was not stable for a 2D bi-modulus problem and proposed a more proper shear modulus to improve the convergence [18], only with modest success.

Recently, a quadratic programming method based on the PVP was developed for nonlinear analysis of bi-modulus truss and tensegrity structures [19]. The PVP method improves the convergence very well and has been demonstrated by numerical tests of the 1D bi-modulus problem, involving in both the small- and large-displacement analyses. Then the PVP formulation was extended to the 2D bi-modulus continuum by Zhang et al. and good convergence of the algorithm was also found [20]. In addition, a series of functional formulations, based on the minimum complementary energy principle, Hellinger–Reissner type mixed variational principle and Hu–Washizu type generalized variational principle, respectively, were proposed by Du and Guo for 3D bi-modulus materials while the elastic bounds of bio-composites were estimated accurately [21]. However, the work is limited to the small-deformation framework. To the authors׳ knowledge, geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials is rarely seen. It is necessary to develop an efficient computational method for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials, which includes both material and geometric nonlinearities. Convergence of the algorithm also needs to be investigated for this issue.

The object of this paper is to develop an efficient computational method, which is based on the parametric variational principle and the co-rotational approach, for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The non-smooth stress–strain relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3, a unified PVP constitutive equation is proposed in principal stress directions and the principle of minimum potential energy is established for small deformation analysis. In Section 4, the PVP formulation for small-deformation analysis is combined with the co-rotational approach to achieve the geometrically nonlinear analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials and then the PVP finite element formulation including incompatible modes is also presented. In Section 5, two numerical examples are employed to investigate the validity and convergence of the proposed PVP-CR algorithm. A novel application for staggered bio-composites is presented, too. Some conclusions are drawn in the final section.

The same as the classical elasticity that has the same moduli in tension and compression, the equilibrium equation and strain–displacement relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials are given by

                     . From Eqs. (4), (8) and (9), it can be found that the stress–strain relationship of 3D bi-modulus materials depends on the principal stress states. Strain discontinuity and absence of the shear modulus in Eq. (7) often cause troubles in traditional iterative solutions [14,15,17,19]. In fact, strain discontinuity may be dealt with a unified constitutive equation, which can describe the eight principal stress states indicated by Eqs. (8) and (9), in order to improve the convergence of the algorithm. To achieve this goal, the PVP for 3D bi-modulus materials will be proposed in the following section.

The unified PVP constitutive equation of 3D bi-modulus materials has been derived so far. Now the eight principal stress states and stress–strain relationships are indicated by the new constitutive equation, Eq. (24a), and the additional complementary equation, Eq. (24b). In the next section, the principle of minimum potential energy with parametric variables will be proposed for numerical analysis with the FEM.

Strain energy of a bi-modulus continuum can be formulated in the principal coordinate system

Note that the parametric variable 
                           λ
                         does not take part in the variational calculation [25], when variation is performed to get the equilibrium equation. The difference between the conventional variational principle (CVP) and the parametric variational principle (PVP) is illustrated in 
                        Fig. 3. Eqs. (29a) and (29b) show that the slack variable 
                           ν
                         is complementary to the parametric variable 
                           λ
                        . It is not difficult to prove that the solution of Eq. (29) is the real displacement of 3D bi-modulus materials subjected to a definite force and displacement boundary. We refer readers to Ref. [22] for the detailed proof on PVP of an elasto-plastic problem which is similar to the one of the bi-modulus problem discussed in this paper.

In this section, the PVP formulation for small deformation analysis presented above is combined with a co-rotational formulation, developed by Moita and Crisfield [24]. A new tangent stiffness matrix, including a parametric variable, is derived based on the parametric variational principle and the co-rotational approach that has been proved efficient for a large-rotation problem [25–28].

The coordinate systems and variables are introduced prior to the presentation of detailed derivation. Two coordinate systems and three configurations are illustrated in

                         via a rigid body rotation and translation. By the co-rotational approach [25], a large deformation from configuration I to III is divided into two steps. The first step refers to a large rigid body motion from the configuration I to II in the global coordinate system O-XYZ; the second step refers to a pure small deformation from configuration II to III in the local coordinate system

Thus the PVP finite element formulation for the small deformation analysis can be used in the local coordinate system as the co-rotational approach is carried out, and then the local formulation can be mapped into the global formulation by transformation from the local to global coordinate system. In the following derivation, the subscript ‘l’ indicates the variables defined in the local coordinate system, while ‘g’ indicates those defined in the global coordinate system.

The transformation relation between the local and global nodal internal force vectors of the one element can be given by

Shear locking occurs when an eight-node brick element is used to analyze a bending dominated problem and it can be eliminated by using incompatible shape functions [29]. The PVP finite element formulation including incompatible modes is presented here, which will be used in the numerical examples behind. The displacement interpolation can be rewritten by adding an additional shape function,

Flow chart of the finite element procedure of the PVP-CR algorithm is shown in 
                        Fig. 5. It can be seen that the local stiffness matrix doesn׳t need to be updated by the current principal stress state when the global tangent stiffness matrix and the local nodal force are calculated. A local linear complementarity problem is solved firstly at the element level to get the parametric variable

                         the MNR-CR algorithm produces the same results with the PVP-CR algorithm at the beginning of loading, but it aborts after only several load steps.

To investigate the convergence of algorithms, convergence curves in the first load step are presented in 
                        Fig. 10. From Fig. 10(a), it can be seen that both the two algorithms converge successfully in the first load step when the load increment is

                        , and the proposed PVP-CR algorithm requires less iterations than the MNR-CR algorithm. However, Fig. 10(b) and (c) show that the MNR-CR algorithm fails to converge as a large load increment is adopted. As shown in Fig. 10(b), oscillation is observed for the MNR-CR algorithm with

                         and Fig. 10(c) shows that the MNR-CR algorithm diverges dramatically after several iterations as a larger load step

                         is adopted. In contrast to the MNR-CR algorithm, the proposed PVP-CR algorithm shows a stable convergence behavior and can achieve the convergence tolerance via a few iterations for all the three cases with different load increments.

Load–displacement curves of the structure are plotted in 
                        Fig. 11 and von Mises stress curves are plotted in 
                        Fig. 12. Three typical deformed shapes of the structure obtained by the PVP-CR algorithm are plotted in 
                        Fig. 13, where the external load at the central node on the top surface is up to 6000. Von Mises stress contours are shown in 
                        Fig. 14. It is visible that the smaller the compressive modulus, the larger the deformation, because the compressive resistance of the material reduces with the decrease of compressive modulus. The distribution of von Mises stress of bi-modulus structures are obviously different from those of classical structures which has the same moduli in tension and compression, which demonstrates that the necessity of applying the bi-modulus elasticity theory to the mechanical analysis of bi-modulus structures with a large value of

As a natural load-bearing bio-composite material with staggered microstructures, nacre has received much attention for recent years [21,30–32]. The microstructure of the nacre scanned by the electric mirror is shown in 
                        Fig. 18, which can be simplified as a ‘brick-mortar’ model shown in 
                        Fig. 19(a). Fig. 19(b) shows a typical representative volume element of the periodic structure. The gap between the mineral materials extends when the structure is in tension, as shown in Fig. 19(c), while the mineral materials contact as the structure is in compression, as shown in Fig. 19(d). This phenomenon is usually called the unilateral contact.

Evans et al. studied the mechanical responses of the nacre and revealed that nacre is of bi-modularity due to the unilateral contact behavior that occurs when the structure is in compression [30]. Ji and Gao proposed an analytical model to determine the effective modulus [31] and Bertodli et al. improved this model and simulated the mechanical responses of the nacre, using the boundary element method (BEM) to achieve a hard contact analysis [7]. Recently, Du and Guo substituted a simple bi-modulus spring model for the hard contact analysis to simulate the unilateral contact behavior. The upper and lower bounds of the staggered bio-composite material are determined by the variational method [21].

In this example, the unilateral contact behavior observed in the microstructure of nacre is simulated by a multi-phase bi-modulus material model and the effective moduli of the staggered bio-composite material are determined by the proposed algorithm. Half of the ‘brick-mortar’ structure shown in Fig. 19(b) is discretized by 414

It can be seen that the effective moduli obtained by the FEM proposed in this paper agree with the ones obtained by the analytical model proposed by Bertoldi et al. [7]. In addition, the results obtained by the FEM locate between the upper (the red line) and lower (the blue line) bounds, predicated by Du and Guo [21] using a variational method, as shown in 
                        Fig. 22. The result is also in a good agreement with the ones in Ref. [21]. This example thus demonstrates the validity of using the bi-modulus material model to simulate the unilateral contact behavior of staggered bio-composite like nacre or other materials with micro-cracks.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper develops an efficient computational method for large-displacement and small-strain analysis of 3D bi-modulus materials. The material nonlinearity is dealt with the parametric variational principle and geometric nonlinearity is formulated by the co-rotational approach that decomposes a large deformation into a rigid body motion in the global coordinate system and a pure small deformation in the local coordinate system. A unified PVP constitutive equation is proposed in the local coordinate system to overcome numerical instability which is caused by strain discontinuity, so that the traditional stress iteration is not required. The proposed PVP-CR algorithm does not require selection of the elastic modulus by the signs of principal stresses while the local stiffness matrix does not require updating when calculating the global stiffness matrix and the nodal internal force. Compared with the traditional iterative solution, the PVP-CR algorithm shows good convergence and can deal with a large load step successfully. Numerical examples indicate that the mechanical responses of bi-modulus materials are apparently different from the ones of classical structures with the same moduli in tension and compression. In addition, the proposed algorithm is successfully used to simulate the unilateral contact behavior of microscopic staggered bio-composites, which suggests that the bi-modulus stress–strain relationship can be used as a model of hard contact. Experimental verification is necessary in future.

The proposed method can be extended to geometrically nonlinear analysis of anisotropic bi-modulus composites.
