@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  We propose a discontinuous finite element method for small strain elasticity allowing for cohesive zone modeling. The method yields a seamless transition between the discontinuous Galerkin method and classical cohesive zone modeling. Some relevant numerical examples are presented.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

In this paper we develop a discontinuous finite element method for cohesive zone modeling using the approach first suggested by Hansbo and Hansbo [3]. Unlike in the standard pre-failure treatment of cohesive zones, which consists of tying the meshes together using a penalty approach, we use a combination of Nitsche׳s method and the cohesive law governing the interelement stiffness, thus allowing the same discretization method in both pre-failure and post-failure regimes. This means that the method is consistent with the original differential equation and no large penalty parameters are required for accurate solutions even in the pre-failure regime. The approach was implemented for cohesive cracks by Hansbo and Heintz [4] in an XFEM setting, but here we consider a discontinuous Galerkin method allowing for discontinuities appearing only between elements.

An approach similar to ours has been suggested by Mergheim et al. [7], and later used by Pretchel et al. [8] for small deformation crack simulations, and Radovitzky et al. [9] and Wu et al. [12] for large deformation crack simulations. The method of [7] however uses a different blending of Nitsche׳s method and cohesive zones. There a discontinuous Galerkin method is used only in the pre-failure regime and a switch to a standard cohesive zone approximation is performed at a given traction threshold. To ensure a continuous transition between the discretization methods, a matching of discrete tractions between the two cases is performed. This matching is cumbersome in a more general situation of nonmatching meshes across the cohesive zone. In this paper we avoid this switch and a more generally applicable method results.

An outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we define our discrete method in a linear setting; in Section 3 we discuss and motivate the cohesive law that we favour and the resulting secant compliance we use in our numerical solution process; and in Section 4 we give some numerical examples of our approach. Finally, in Section 5, we give some concluding remarks.

The DG method can then be formulated as follows: Seek

By use of Green׳s formula, we readily establish that the method (2) is consistent in the sense that

                         sufficiently regular, which is key to retrieving optimal accuracy of the method. Stability follows from the analysis in [2,3,5]. We also mention the work of Juntunen and Stenberg [6], where an analysis of this approach for handling general boundary conditions for Poisson׳s equation is given.

We are now interested in the case when the interface compliance depends on the jump of the solution, 
                        K
                        =
                        K
                        (
                        〚
                        u
                        〛
                        )
                     . In the numerical solution of the cohesive zone FE model, we shall for ease of implementation use a secant method for the nonlinear solver. Thus, we replace the compliance 
                        K
                      by a corresponding secant compliance as follows.

The compliance between the elements can be defined a priori by cohesive zone models. Frequently, cohesive zone models that are easy to implement are chosen to model the initiation of cracks. These models are often un-coupled, meaning that there is no relationship between the normal and tangential stresses other than the fracture criterion. However, it is reasonable to imagine that the tangetial stiffness is effected by the reduction of the normal stiffness. Thus, in order to couple the cohesive behavior of the interfaces in mixed mode, we choose to derive the traction–separation laws from a weighted energy release rate surface, cf. [11,1].

We denote the energy release rates in pure normal and pure tangential directions

The shapes of the traction–separation curves in each pure mode, respectively, are obtained by differentiating the energy release rates in each pure mode with respect to each pure mode relative separation, u
                     
                        n

                        t
                     . From these curves, laws are chosen that captures the most essential features of the curves. Fig. 3
                      shows two idealized schematic curves.

In order to capture the behavior of the cohesive law in mixed mode, the two energy release rate curves in Fig. 2 are combined to yield a surface where the axes are total energy release rate, 
                        Γ
                     , relative normal and relative tangential separations, u

This first numerical example is intended to illustrate problems concerning mesh dependence of the crack path. The specimen is a rectangular block with a hole that is asymmetrically placed. The dimensions of the specimen are given by width and height according to W=1.00mm, H=1.00mm and the hole diameter D=0.20mm, respectively. The hole is located at center coordinate

                        0.45
                     . The maximum cohesive strengths are set to 1MPa and the maximum critical separations are set to 0.02mm in the cohesive sawtooth model giving a fracture energy of 0.1J/mm2. The domain is discretized in two different ways, where the first contains a section which has a somewhat structured mesh at the mid section, see Fig. 5
                      on the left, and the second which has an unstructured mesh for the same region, see Fig. 6
                      on the left.

As is observed in both figures, the crack initiates and propagates similarly. However, due to the fact that the crack is constrained to propagate along the element boundaries, slight differences should be expected. Also, once a crack has initiated in a particular direction along an element boundary, the crack driving force will be directed along this boundary. Thus, depending on the alignment of the first initial crack, this will change the load case momentarily to some extent. Nevertheless, it should be evident that this effect will have less impact for a finer discretization.

In this second example, a specimen with two inclusions and an initial crack, see Fig. 7
                     , is used to show the applicability of the modeling technique. The dimensions of the specimen are given by

                     , D=0.20mm, a=0.20mm. The lower right inclusion is located at center coordinate

Two different set-ups are modeled for comparison. The first is a specimen where the inclusions have the same material properties as the rest of the specimen with elastic material properties; E=10MPa and 
                        ν
                        =
                        0.45
                     . The second is a specimen where Young׳s modulus of the inclusions is 100 times greater than in the rest of the specimen. The maximum cohesive strengths are set to 1MPa and the maximum critical separations are set to 0.02mm in the cohesive sawtooth model giving a fracture energy of 
                        0.1
                        
                        J
                        /
                        
                           
                              mm
                           
                           
                              2
                           
                        
                     . Note that these properties are the same for both set-ups.

One of the major issues with this type of modeling is mesh dependency. However, if a large number of elements are used the mesh dependency is obviously reduced. Furthermore, the compliance between all continuum elements introduce numerical issues which can be reduced by an increase of the elastic stiffness of the cohesive zone model sufficiently to minimize the compliance. In the present model, the compliance is allowed to be initially zero and then gradually increases as the load is increased. Damage initiation, and essentially crack propagation, is enabled by a decrease of the stiffness according to (17) where the interfaces, as stated in the definition of the method, are given as the boundaries between all the continuum elements (this is of course not a requirement, as a mix of continuous and discontinuous methods is also possible). Thus, cracks are free to form, nucleate and propagate along the continuum element boundaries by Nitsche׳s method instead of the standard approach of using cohesive elements, as in, e.g., [10,13].

For the first set-up, see Fig. 8
                     , the crack initiates as expected and then it propagates without considering the inclusions. In the second set-up, however, the crack is arrested by the stiffer inclusion boundary and deflects downwards around the lower right inclusion to finally to continue to propagate to the free edge of the specimen, see Fig. 9
                     . It can be seen for both set-ups that there is virtually no compliance issues prior to any cracks forming. Both simulations, thus shows the applicability of the modeling technique.

In this paper, we have suggested an FE method which seamlessly blends the discontinuous Galerkin method with classical cohesive zone models. There is no need for interface elements as the interelement stiffness is represented by a modification of the weak form. There is no need to identify threshold values for transitions between discretization approaches since the same bilinear form is used for all cases of interface stiffness. The method also directly allows for modeling cohesive zones between non-matching meshes, unlike the similar approach suggested previously in [7], which does not immediately generalize to this case.
