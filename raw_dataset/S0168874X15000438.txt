@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  In this work, we propose a new enhancement strategy that can be applied to the calculated strain field in the analyses of shells by the unconstrained-vector finite element approach, a Solid-Shell-like formulation. This new enhancement is proposed to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stresses fields in the transverse direction. The kinematic enhancement is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, we propose an alternative plastic flow rule, which includes a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and a general failure surface that degenerates into the von-Mises or Drucker−Prager criteria for isotropic materials. The resulting alternative position-based finite element and the enhanced field strategies are tested for elastic and elastoplastic situations by comparing the results with other solutions and known benchmarks.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a powerful tool for structural analysis and in its most common version is based on the stationary total potential energy principle. For plate and shell analyses, it is usual to assume rotations and simplified displacement fields in the thickness direction to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. These simplified displacement fields are usually classified as the Classical Laminated Theory, First-Order Theory and subsequent Higher-Order Theories [1]. However, the starting points of these approaches are the Kirchhoff−Love kinematics [2,3] and the Reissner−Mindlin kinematics [4–6]. Before describing recent studies on this subject, it is important to note that the position-based formulation presented here is a Solid-Shell-like approach that was developed initially for homogeneous shells [7,8], does not consider rotations as variables and naturally allows thickness variation therefore, it cannot be classified as one of the displacement-rotation approaches mentioned above.

In existing finite element (FE) formulations for laminated plates and shells, the adopted transverse displacement fields are usually continuously differentiable [9,10]. Therefore, the resulting strain field is also continuous and, because the constitutive relation is discontinuous (constant in each lamina), the achieved stress field becomes discontinuous. Several important recent studies [11–16] have focused on improving the stress analysis and other issues by following the displacement−rotation formulations of laminated plates and shells. Readers are invited to read these studies for important information and a good review on the subject of displacement−rotation-based formulations.

The so-called hybrid method is an alternative FE procedure that can be used to improve the accuracy of stress fields in FEMs in which the stress (or strain) fields are introduced as new variables [17,18]. In these techniques, Lagrange multipliers can be employed to partially enforce the continuity conditions and compatibility for inter-elemental fields. These Lagrange multipliers are the energy conjugate values of the new unknowns of the problem and increase the number of degrees of freedom. A well-known strategy that improves the shear stress continuity along the thickness in rotation−displacement formulations is the layer-wise theory [1,19]. The thickness of the plate or shell elements is divided into a suitable number of sub-elements that are usually coincident with the physical laminas, and each is described by a First-Order Theory. The top and bottom displacements of each lamina are forced to match the displacements of adjacent laminas. This procedure results in N sub-elements with 2N+3 independent displacements, which increases the number of degrees of freedom [19–21].

This study introduces a position-based FEM to address the development of plasticity and large deformations in laminated plates and shells. The formulation is different from previous formulations in that it does not use the concepts of rotation and displacements. Moreover, the strain field that is calculated from the alternative kinematics is enhanced to satisfy the continuity of the shear and normal stress fields in the transverse direction of laminated plates and shells. The kinematics are enhanced based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium that is associated with maintaining the elastic strain energy potential in the transverse direction of the shell or plate. No additional degrees of freedom are introduced, and a coherent continuous stress distribution is achieved from the enhanced strain field.

The initial positional mapping is called pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics [5–7] because no enhancements are imposed and the shear strain is constant along the thickness (discontinuous stress). We call basic kinematics the improvement to the pure kinematics introducing a variable that allows linear thickness variation [8] that avoids volumetric and shear locking in both thin and thick plates and shells. The enhancement is proposed based on these initial kinematics. This procedure guarantees good results from the basic kinematics [8,22] for transverse displacements and stresses parallel to the reference surface without increasing the number of degrees of freedom. Moreover, using the proposed enhancement, transverse strains will be discontinuous, which provides the desired continuity of stresses.

It should be noted that some versions of the well-established Solid-Shell finite element approach [23–30] precedes our formulation on using vectors instead of rotations to solve shells problems; therefore our approach is classified as a Solid-Shell-like formulation. There are two main differences between these formulations. The first and less important difference is that positions are used as variables instead of displacements. The second is that the Solid-Shell formulation when written as function of mid surface, directors and thickness [25] “imposes a multiplicative decomposition of the director field into an inextensible vector part and a scalar stretching part” [23], and our formulation does not.

To complete the formulation, an alternative non-associative orthotropic elastoplastic constitutive relation is presented and used with the proposed strain enhancement. This elastoplastic formulation is based on controlling the volume change in the plastic phase, which reduces locking problems [31,32]. Moreover, in contrast to typical elastoplastic procedures, the hardening parameter is not a fixed scalar but depends on the orthotropic directions of the material and on the intensity of the current stress state. Examples are shown to demonstrate the good behavior of the solution and the final stress behavior in the transverse direction. Most sections of this paper use dyadic notation; however, index notation is employed in some parts of the text to facilitate understanding.

This section describes the general solution to our mechanical problem, i.e., large deformations of plates and shells that include continuous transverse stresses and plasticity. Two important issues are raised from the solution process: the need to adopt a kinematics and the consideration of a coherent constitutive relation. These issues will be explored in the next sections. To solve the mechanical problem, we use the principle of stationary total potential energy. The problem is assumed to be isothermal, and external loads are considered to be conservative. Therefore, the total potential energy is written as:

The variation of Eq. (1) is equal to zero at the equilibrium position. Therefore, a position-based formulation consists of finding a position 
                        Y
                      that satisfies the assumption:

Because the main variable of the problem is

is the tangent constitutive tensor, which is given in Eq. (105). The derivatives of the Green strain with respect to the positions come from Eqs. (18), (21) and (23) and are detailed in references [7,8].

To describe the general kinematics, we begin with a homogeneous shell and generate the initial expressions. The initial kinematic assumption is that a straight line that is initially orthogonal to the reference surface of a plate (or shell) will remain straight but not necessarily orthogonal to the reference surface after deformation. Although this line may change size (thickness variation), this assumption is similar to the original Reissner−Mindlin hypothesis [5,6] and will be called pure kinematics as was presented by [7] and is depicted in 
                     Fig. 1.

In Fig. 1, a generic point

                        y
                      in the current configuration is written as a function of a point

The pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics (Eqs. (17) and (18)) will be used to generate the desired strain enhancement modes in Section 5. However, the resulting enhancement will be applied to Eq. (20), which is called the basic kinematics.

The basic kinematics (that will be enhanced) is are developed by introducing the linear rate of thickness variation (scalar), which is parameterized by its nodal values

This kinematic eliminates volumetric and shear locking from the usual homogeneous or laminated shell formulations [8]. Higher-order polynomials can be used to improve the basic kinematics even more; this has been done in studies of rotation−displacement formulations [1,9,10]. However, creating continuous displacement fields does not generate continuous stress fields.

In Section 5, we propose a strain enhancement for the position-based formulation that generates a more coherent stress distribution in the transverse direction without increasing the number of degrees of freedom.

The nonexistence of a finite rotation description allows the laminate kinematics to be understood using a simple two dimensional representation, which is depicted in 
                     Fig. 2.

In Sections 2 and 3, the variables are defined in the global coordinate system. However, because the adopted constitutive model considers an orthotropic material for each lamina of the plate (or shell), it is necessary to create a local coordinate system at each integration point that follows the local orthotropic coordinate system. The constitutive relation and the new kinematics enhancement will be applied in this system.


                     
                     Fig. 3 shows the adopted Lagrangian orthotropic directions at a specific point. The third orthotropic direction is the normal to the plate or shell surface, which is called

To apply the proposed enhancement, we rotate the nodal positions and unconstrained vectors to the Lagrangian local orthotropic coordinate system at each integration point.

The transverse shear enhancement mode is based on the in-plane longitudinal stress equilibrium such that no changes occur in the strain energy that is calculated along a vertical line for pure Reissner−Mindlin (constant transverse strain) kinematics. Three enhancement modes are developed: two shear modes for orthotropic planes 1 and 2 (

Finally, instead of applying the enhancements (56) and (57) over the pure kinematics as represented by Eqs. (47) and (50), we apply them to Eqs. (33) and (34) (or 31) and (32); that is, over the basic kinematic strain. Therefore, a slight change of strain energy is expected but is restricted to the enhancement term, which is the rate of thickness variation.

The intensity of the normal stress in the transverse direction of the shell is usually small; therefore, it is acceptable to consider a constant normal stress

                        . The strain energy per unit length that develops in the third orthotropic direction due to this constant normal stress is calculated as

when it is used with Eq. (32).

It is important to note that the enhancement modes (Eqs. (56), (57) and (66)) are calculated using the pure Reissner−Mindlin kinematics; however, they are applied to the so-called basic kinematic strains (Eqs. (31) and (32)), for which

                           0
                        . Therefore, a slight change of the strain energy is expected but is restricted to the enhancement term; i.e., the rate of thickness variation. The final transverse normal stress will not be constant but will be continuous.

The second part of this study is the development of an alternative orthotropic multi-linear 3D elastoplastic constitutive relation. The differences between this formulation and typical ones are the plastic flow independence of any plastic potential and the dependence of hardening on the orthotropic directions. This allows the imposition of the volume change in the plastic phase, including the usual isochoric situation. The proposed elastoplastic formulation is based on the bilinear isotropic elastoplastic model proposed by [36]. To simplify the notation, the upper bar, which is related to the local coordinate orientation, is omitted.

We consider small or moderate strains because these applications are typically associated with common structural materials, such as steel and concrete. Therefore, the Green strain approaches the linear strain, and we assume the additive decomposition of strain:

                         from simple uniaxial parameters is described in Appendix A. As mentioned previously, in expression (78), 
                           χ
                         is assumed to be a scalar and results in scalar values for 
                           α
                         and 
                           H
                         in Eqs. (76) and (74). It is worth noting that the hardening parameter 
                           H
                         will be divided into volumetric and isochoric parts. Moreover, we present a simple strategy to consider different hardenings depending on the stress evolution and orthotropic directions in Appendix A.

Generalizing what is proposed by [36], instead of using a known plastic potential, we control Eqs. (75) and (76) by writing:

In Section 2, the Newton−Raphson procedure is used to solve the equilibrium, and the elastoplastic tangent tensor is required to improve the convergence rate. To determine this tensor, we use the fact that the variation of the yielding function is null (

Five examples are shown to validate the enhanced kinematics and the proposed elastoplastic formulation.

Although the present formulation was developed for elastoplastic analysis, it is important to validate the elastic stress distribution by comparing the calculated values with existing benchmarks. This example is used to show that the proposed enhancement is capable of modeling the displacements and stresses of moderately thick laminated plates and provides stress distributions that are consistent with those determined by analytical solutions.

The structure is a simply-supported square plate that is subjected to a uniform load and consists of three layers that are symmetrical with respect to the middle surface (
                        Fig. 4). The length to thickness ratio is 
                           a

                        , so the structure may be considered thick [21]. The ratio R of the elastic properties of the face sheets to those of core is varied from 5 to 100 to compare the displacements. Fig. 4 shows the geometry adopted by [34] to solve this problem analytically. The core (reference) elastic properties are

These displacements are compared to the rotation−displacement-based Layerwise Theory (LWT) and Third Order Theory (TOT) presented by [21]. The analytical 3D solution and the analytical thin-plate theory solution from [34] are also plotted in Fig. 5. The displacements that were calculated using our basic kinematics approach those from the thin plate analytical solution, while the displacements calculated using our enhanced kinematics approach those from the LWT and analytical solutions for the tested thick plate.

To show that the proposed formulation is able to solve thin and very thin shell problems without focusing on stress calculations, we calculate the central deflection of a square simply-supported plate with sides

                        , and the same mesh (16×16 elements) is adopted.

The applied distributed load is calibrated such that the central displacement that is calculated by the Navier series solution for Kirchhoff׳s plate theory remains constant and equal to 
                           δ
                           =
                           1.0
                           
                           mm
                        , which represents small displacements.

As is well known, Kirchhoff׳s plate theory uses the plane stress assumption, which does not occur in real applications. Because of this simplification, Kirchhoff׳s plate theory gives larger displacements than the corresponding real plate situation for thin and very thin plates. This occurs because only the first of the following 6 strain compatibility equations is respected; the others are disregarded by Kirchhoff׳s plate theory.

Therefore, our displacement solution is expected to assume a constant value for the central deflection (no locking) but be smaller than the solution from Kirchhoff׳s plate theory. For this example, it is possible to show the existence of this incompatible strain field in Kirchhoff׳s plate theory by relaxing the transverse elastic modulus of our orthotropic solution using the empirical formula

                        Table 10 shows that the solution of our formulation for thin and very thin plates is, for this case of 
                           0.95
                           
                           mm
                        , i.e.,

                           %
                         less than the solution from Kirchhoff׳s plate theory. This gives a more flexible result than the real result, and our solution is nearly constant for 
                           h
                           /

                        ; i.e., no locking occurs. Moreover, the last column confirms that the five strain compatibility equations are disregarded by Kirchhoff׳s plate theory; by decreasing the transverse elastic modulus, we relax these compatibility equations.

It is important to note that when our results are larger than those of Kirchhoff׳s plate theory, the influence of the shear strain becomes important and introduces more flexibility to the plate. As discussed previously, our solution does not change when we use

                         is stretched by a distributed in-plane load as shown in 
                        Fig. 8a. The orthotropic direction is indicated by the arbitrary angle 
                           θ
                        . The adopted discretization is depicted in Fig. 8b.


                        
                        Fig. 9 shows the uniaxial stress−strain diagrams from which the elastoplastic constitutive model is constructed following the strategy that is proposed in Appendix A. It is important to note that the third orthotropic direction is equal to the second; moreover, the uniaxial stress−strain diagrams are equal in tension and compression.

                        , respectively.

In Figs. 10 and 11, the uniaxial values of Fig. 9 are used as reference values. The results illustrate the good behavior of the adopted model for extreme situations and the coherent results for intermediate cases, such as the dependence of hardening on the orthotropic direction.

A short laminated clamped beam (
                        Fig. 13) is analyzed using three different approaches with the same computational code. The first approach considers the beam as a solid, and its width is modeled by the thickness of our shell finite element; see 
                        Fig. 14 for the resulting discretization. The second approach considers the short beam as a plate following the basic kinematics; the shear stress

                         is discontinuous. The third approach is similar to the second, but the shear stress

The distributed load is applied to the transverse shell in equal increments of

                        Fig. 16 shows the load/displacement curve. The displacement is measured at the free end of the beam, and the total load is used as a reference. 
                        Fig. 17 shows a qualitative view of the material degradation (equivalent plastic strain) at the failure load for the solid representation of the beam.

The results show that while the proposed enhancement is able to perfectly characterize the failure load, the basic kinematics predicts a load that is 5.5 times greater than the expected one. The results reveal the importance of a good approximation for the shear stresses when developing plate and shell finite element formulations. Moreover, the results verify the excellent behavior of the proposed strain enhancement. To be complete, 
                        Fig. 18 shows the shear stress distribution (at the second load level) for both shell kinematics in the transverse direction at a distance

                         from the clamped end. The concrete shear stress is under-predicted by the basic kinematics, which prevents collapse from occurring at the proper load.


                        
                        Fig. 19 shows the shear stress distribution obtained at the second load level using the solid approach. The shear stress is consistent with that predicted by the proposed enhanced strain model. A small shear stress concentration appears in the steel and is not captured by the enhanced formulation. However, this concentration is small and does not change the overall behavior of the analysis.

In addition to validating the proposed enhancement for use in the analysis of bending laminated plates and shells, this example also reveals the good behavior of our formulation when working in the membrane direction (Fig. 9).

The developed formulation is used to solve the pinching of an elastoplastic cylindrical shell. The elastic formulation has been tested for large deformations [8,22] and compared with benchmarks developed by [35] and [18].

                        Fig. 20.

To run this example, one-eighth of the cylinder is discretized by a 24×30 mesh with 6643 nodes (
                        Fig. 21a). The applied load and the complete geometry are depicted in Fig. 21b. Because the load is concentrated, a small region of the mesh (3×4 elements) is considered to be perfectly elastic to avoid plastic localization.

The position is controlled using 19 steps of

                        Fig. 22 compares the calculated elastoplastic equilibrium path to the elastic result. The elastoplastic case is more flexible than the elastic case before the displacement reaches one-third of the cylinder׳s radius. However, due to the differences in the geometric configurations, the elastoplastic case shows a stiffer behavior than the elastic case along a considerable displacement interval. The elastic case shows geometrical softening after the critical displacement of

                        Fig. 23 shows the positions of the elastoplastic and elastic cases for the imposed displacement of

                           mm
                         under the applied load.

To clarify the difference in the positions and to justify the stiffer behavior of the elastoplastic case, 
                        Fig. 24 shows a superposition of the elastically deformed mesh from Fig. 23b and the elastoplastic displacement isocurves from Fig. 23a. The elastic positions form a nearly horizontal plateau, while the elastoplastic positions form an inclined pattern. This means that the membrane׳s stiffness is more pronounced in the elastoplastic solution, which causes the observed stiffer behavior.


                        
                        Fig. 25 shows the qualitative plastic strains that develop at various levels of the applied load on the inner surface of the shell.

In 
                        Fig. 26, the range of plastic strain is changed to illustrate the parts of the shell that have passed through yielding at different displacements.

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

This paper presented a positional FEM formulation with a regularized stress distribution in the transverse direction that was applied to the analysis of elastoplastic thin and moderately thick laminated plates and shells. In addition, a new concept of the hardening parameter that depends on the orthotropic directions of the material was developed to include orthotropic elastoplastic 3D materials. The proposed methodology that uses the enhanced kinematics to achieve a continuous transverse stress provides very good results and does not increase the number of degrees of freedom. The strain enhancement modes are based on equilibrium equations, energy conservation and constitutive relations. The proposed formulation is capable of accurately reproducing the transverse displacements, and no locking was detected for moderately thick and thin plates. The developed enhancement modes proved to be effective and give almost identical values to the tested shear stress distributions of thin and moderately thick plates. The proposed elastoplastic model works properly and can be used for general applications. Moreover, the failure predictions for laminated structural members are consistent with those predicted by solid models.

                         is null, the von-Mises surface holds.

For an orthotropic material, we will call 
                           x
                         the tensional reference strength in the first orthotropic direction, 
                           x
                           ′
                         the compressional reference strength in the first orthotropic direction, 
                           y
                         the tensional reference strength in the second orthotropic direction, 
                           y
                           ′
                         the compressional reference strength in the second orthotropic direction, 
                           z
                         the tensional reference strength in the third orthotropic direction, and 
                           z
                           ′
                        the compressional reference strength in the third orthotropic direction.

By applying a least squares average to degenerate the orthotropic model into a Drucker−Prager surface when isotropy holds, we propose the non-null values of

From these values, the active scalar value is given by a linear scaling that is based on the current normal stress that acts in the orthotropic directions:

                           shows the good behavior of this strategy, which was not found in previous studies. It is important to note that to define the multi-linear one-dimensional stress-strain diagrams, the same strain constraints must be imposed in all orthotropic directions. This procedure has the same meaning for the partial hardening parameters of Eq. (A9).
