Nonlocal continuum theory

Mixed finite element method

Size-dependent effect

Nanobeams

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  This paper aims to present the mixed finite element method for the static analysis of nanobeams. The size-dependent effect of nanostructures is taken into consideration by nonlocal continuum theory. The governing equation is derived for Euler–Bernoulli beam theory incorporated with nonlocal theory. The present mixed finite element method is first introduced to overcome the concentrated loading problem of nonlocal beam which is a major limitation of the regular finite element formulation. Numerical results are obtained and compared with previously published works to show the applicability and accuracy of the present model. By introducing two coefficients α
                     1 and α
                     2, the mixed finite element model could be useful to describe the static responses of nanobeams.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

It is known that due to the absence of the internal material length scale in the constitutive equation, the classical theory fails to predict the behaviour at the nano-scale which was reported in Fleck et al. [1], Stölken and Evans [2] and Lam et al. [3]. In order to consider the size-dependent effect, numerous size-dependent continuum theories (e.g., nonlocal theory [4], strain gradient theory [5], modified couple stress theory [6], and peridynamic theory [7,8]), which can capture the nano-scale effect, have been developed to study the behaviour of nanostructures. This paper is devoted to analyse nonlocal theory for nanobeam structures. In the local (classical) continuum theories based on the hyperelastic constitutive relations, the stress state at a reference point is only a function of strain state at that point. The nonlocal continuum theory initially developed by Eringen [4] and Eringen and Edelen [9] indicates that the stress state at a reference point is a function of every strain state in the continuum body. Thus, the nonlocal theory can take the forces between atoms and small length scale into consideration.

Applications of the nonlocal continuum theory have attracted many researchers to investigate the mechanical behaviour of single or multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphenes. Nanotubes and graphenes are modelled and formulated as beam structures (e.g., [10–14]) and plate structures (e.g., [15–20]) considering nonlocal effect, respectively. The application of the nonlocal elastic theory to model carbon nanotubes and graphenes was summarized in research of Arash and Wang [21].

Due to the possibility of nonlocal theory to model carbon nanotubes as beam structures, considerable research efforts have been made to deal with the static, vibration and buckling behaviour of beams considering nonlocal continuum theory. Peddieson et al. [22] initially utilized the nonlocal continuum theory to develop the nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli beam model for the static analysis of beam. They concluded that the nonlocal effect could be useful and significant for nanostructures. In their work, the nonlocal effect was vanished for a cantilever beam subjected to any combination of concentrated loads. Lu et al. [23] investigated the wave and vibration properties of single or multi-walled carbon nanotubes by using the nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam models. They discussed some issues on deriving stress resultants, governing equations, and boundary conditions of the nonlocal beam model. Thai [24] studied the static, buckling, and vibration analysis of nonlocal beam using higher order shear deformation beam theory. Wang et al. [25] expressed the analytical solutions for deflections, rotations and stress resultants for the nonlocal Timoshenko beam subjected to transverse distributed load. Pradhan and Murmu [26] investigated the flapwise bending vibration of nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli cantilever beam. The governing equation was derived and solved by using differential quadrature method. Emam [27] presented the analytical solution for buckling and postbukling analysis of nonlocal nonlinear nanobeams with the classical, first order and higher-order shear deformation beam theories. Comprehensive research on the static, free vibration, and buckling was reported by Reddy and Pang [28] based on Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beam theories. The analytical solutions of the simply supported, cantilever, and clamped beams were obtained for bending, free vibration, and buckling problems. Reddy [29] reformulated various beam theories including the Euler–Bernoulli, Timoshenko, Reddy, and Levinson beam theories incorporated with the nonlocal continuum theory for the bending, free vibration, and buckling of nonlocal beam. In particular, for bending analysis, the point load problem for the nonlocal theory was solved by using Navier solution which transforms every loading type into the distributed load by using Fourier series formulation. Reddy [30] also developed his research for the nonlinear bending of classical and shear deformation theories of nonlocal beams and nonlocal plates. Aydogdu [31] also presented Navier solution to deal with the point load problem for the simply supported beam. In his study, the length of beam was changed to investigate the length-scale effect. Moreover, in order to deal with the point load problem, Wang and Liew[32] introduced Dirac delta function involved with point load in the governing equation of static analysis of nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli and Timoshenko beams. Owing to the advantage of Dirac delta function, the nonlocal effect would be presented for various nonlocal nanobeams subjected to the point load. Civalek and Demir [33] also exploited this method to investigate the bending analysis of microtubules using nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. The application of differential quadrature method was used to obtain the solution for different boundary conditions. In addition, Civalek and Akgoz [34] carried out free vibration analysis of micro-scaled annular sector and sector shaped graphene embedded in Winkler–Pasternak elastic foundations. In the other hand, finite element method was used to investigate the behaviour of nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli beam and nonlocal Timoshenko beam by Phadikar and Pradhan [35] and Pradhan [36]. A nonlocal beam subjected to the point load was not investigated in their study due to the fact that the nonlocal effect is excluded from the finite element model. Adhikari et al. [37] presented a dynamic finite element method for axially free vibration of nonlocal rods. Moreover, Alotta et al. [38] present a finite element model for Timoshenko beam based on the key idea that nonlocal effects consist of long-range volume forces/moments exchanged by non-adjacent beam segments, which contribute to the equilibrium of a beam segment along with the classical local stress resultants. This nonlocal model was proposed and developed by Paola [39] and colleagues [40–44]. The finite element model proposed by Alotta et al. [38] can overcome the puzzling fact of nonlocal beam model under point load and agree very well with the experimental data of Lam et al. [3]. Additionally, in order to overcome some questionable phenomena of nonlocal model such as the vanishing of nonlocal effect for concentrated loading problem, Challamel and Wang [45] introduced the so-called new nonlocal model or hybrid nonlocal model which is combined from the conventional nonlocal theory and the strain gradient theory. Zhang et al. [46] employed the hybrid nonlocal theory introduced by Challamel and Wang [45] to examine the bending, buckling and vibrationalbehaviours of beam. In their work, the obtained solutions from the hybrid nonlocal theory were remarkably different to those obtained by the nonlocal theory.

From the previously cited references, it is worth noting that in spite of the fact that extensive researches for nonlocal beams have been carried out, to the best of authors’ knowledge, very little attention is given to the static analysis of the nonlocal nanobeams subjected to point load. Navier solution [29,31] and Dirac delta function [32,33] were derived to address the concentrated loading problem of nonlocal beam. However, such analytical solutions cannot generally handle arbitrary complicated geometries, material properties, loading types, and boundary conditions whereas finite element method [35,36] cannot take the point load problem of nonlocal beam into account. Motivated by these reasons, this study is devoted to express the mixed finite element method as a first numerical method to overcome the point load problem for the static analysis of the nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli nanobeam. The novelty and efficiency of this model is addressed and verified, especially for the point load problem. The outline of this paper is as follows: The nonlocal elasticity theory is presented in Section 2. The mixed finite element model is formulated and derived in Section 3. The numerical results are carried out in Section 4. The accuracy and reliability of this study is presented and demonstrated by comparing the results with published works. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn.

It is known that in contrast to the constitutive equation in the classical elasticity, the nonlocal elasticity theory by Eringen [47] states that the stress at a point x in an elastic continuum body depends not only on the strain at point x but also on those at all other points of the body. Therefore, the nonlocal stress tensor σ at point x is expressed as Reddy [29] and Pradhan [36]:

                      denotes the nonlocal parameter which reveals the small scale effect on the responses of structures of nanosize. In nonlocal theory research, the choice of nonlocal parameter is very vital. In all available literatures, one research tendency is that the nonlocal parameter is set as a variable and researches attempt to examine the size-dependent behaviour of structures. Another approach is to measure the nonlocal parameter by matching the results from nonlocal model and experimental results or MD simulation. For example, Duan et al. [48] calibrated the parameter e
                     
                        o
                      by matching the closed-form solution for the free vibration of single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and MD simulation. Their findings indicate that the parameter e
                     
                        o
                      varies between 0 and 19 depending on the length-to-diameter ratio, boundary conditions, and mode shapes of SWCNT. In addition, Arash and Ansari [49] studied the vibration characteristics of SWCNT subjected to an initial strain. The obtained results were compared with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to estimate the nonlocal parameter

Now it is assumed that the nonlocal bending moment is equivalent to the equilibrium bending moment except for the locations where the concentrated load (point load) and the constraint on geometry are applied. There the nonlocal bending moment is calibrated by the coefficient α
                     1 and α
                     2, respectively:

It is seen from Eq. (20) that we can fully consider or omit the effect of nonlocal bending moment where the concentrated load and the constraint on geometry are applied by choosing α
                     1 and α
                     2 equal to 1 or 0, respectively. Therefore, in this study, it is supposed that the modified coefficients α
                     1 and α
                     2 are taken in the range 
                        [
                        
                           0
                           ,
                           1
                        
                        ]
                     .

From Eqs. (17) and (18), we suggest that both deflection and bending moment could be interpolated by linear Lagrange interpolation function:

                     , respectively. It is well-known that the regular finite element method for Euler–Bernoulli beam requires Hermite cubic interpolation function with C
                     1 continuity to properly represent the displacement field. However, for the mixed finite element method, Lagrange linear interpolation functions (C
                     0 continuity) is sufficient to obtain accurate solution.

Substituting Eq. (21) into Eqs. (17) and (18), we obtain the mixed finite element model as follows:

From the studies of Phadikar and Pradhan [35] and Pradhan [36] using the regular finite element method, one can see that the nonlocal parameter is directly associated with the transverse distributed load in force vector. As a result, the regular finite element model can only capture the nonlocal effect for the nonlocal beam subjected to distributed load. For a nonlocal beam subjected to the point load, it is easy to see that the regular finite element method cannot take the influence of the nonlocality into consideration. In the other words, the regular finite element solutions for the nonlocal beam subjected to point load would be identical with the local theory solution in this case. As aforementioned discussion, in order to overcome the problem of applied point load, some techniques are exploited such as Navier solution [29,31] and Dirac delta function [32,33]. On the contrary, for the mixed finite element model, the nonlocal parameter

                      exists inside the stiffness matrix as given in Eq. (23), regardless of force vector. Therefore, the mixed finite element model has the capacity to capture the nonlocal effect for arbitrary loading types. The efficiency and accuracy of the present method will be addressed in next section.

The matrix equation (22) in terms of the nodal values of the deflection and the bending moment can be converted to the following matrix equation in terms of the deflection

Numerical results are carried out for nanobeams with the typical boundary conditions such as simply supported, cantilever, and clamped boundary conditions. The proposed mixed finite element method (MFE) is utilized to study the static behaviour of nanobeams which can be used to model the nanotubes or the beam-type nanostructures. Wang and Liew [32] discussed in their research that the nonlocal effect is only significant when the length of structure is under 20nm. Moreover, Wang [50] suggested that the range of nonlocal parameter

                      should be used for single-wall nanotubes. Therefore, in the numerical examples, we consider a nanobeam subjected to uniform load q and intermediate point load P with material properties and geometries given in Table 1
                     . The results are compared with the published works given by using Fourier series method [29,31,52], Dirac delta function method [32], finite element method [36], and analytical method [25].

The simply supported beams subjected to uniformly distributed load q and point load P are taken into consideration as a benchmark example. As discussed in Section 3, the nonlocal boundary conditions are concerned with the coefficients α
                        1, α
                        2 which are used to modify the nonlocal bending moment at locations with applied constrained geometry and applied point load, respectively. The deformed shape of the simply supported beam subjected to uniform load q is shown in Fig. 1
                         with respect to various values α
                        1, α
                        2. It is interesting to see that the present MFE solutions are irrespective of coefficients 
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 1
                              
                           
                           ,
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                        . Due to the disappearance of applied point load for this case, it is obvious that the MFE solutions should be independent of α
                        2. Additionally, the equilibrium bending moment M
                        
                           E
                         at two beam ends of the simply supported beam is always zero. Consequently, the effect of coefficient α
                        1 is vanished as given in Eq. (20) for applied constrained geometry. Moreover, the present MFE solutions are identical with the analytical solutions of Wang et al. [25].

In Table 2
                        , the deflections at midpoint of the simply supported beam under uniform load q are tabulated and compared with the solutions of Reddy [29], Aydogdu [31], Pradhan [36], and Şimşek and Yurtcu [52]. Obviously, the obtained results are in good agreement with the results from the available literatures for 
                           L
                           /

                        . For 
                           L
                           /
                           h
                           =
                           20
                        , the good agreement is also observed from MFE solutions and solutions of Aydogdu [31], Şimşek and Yurtcu [52], whereas the solutions of Reddy [29] and Pradhan [36] do not vary with the change of ratio 
                           L
                           /
                           h
                        . It can be explained from the fundamental assumption that the nonlocal effect would be neglected in the thickness direction. Thus, changing the height of the beam and keeping the length do not affect the nonlocal effect as given in [29]. This phenomenon is also discussed in the research of Aydogdu [31]. Additionally, from the study by Wang et al. [25], it is clearly seen that after normalizing by the bending rigidity EI, the solutions are independent of the height of nanobeam. Moreover, the nonlocal effect significantly manifest itself for the smaller length of nanobeam and the increase of nonlocal parameter 
                           
                              
                                 e

                           a
                         leads to the increase of deflection. In other words, the appearance of the nonlocal effect softens the simply supported beam under uniform load.

Similarly, the simply supported beam under point load P at midpoint is considered and the deformed shape of beam is plotted in Fig. 2
                        . In accordance with above example, the coefficient α
                        1 does not influence the solution of the simply supported beam subjected to applied point load at midpoint. For 
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           =
                           1
                        , the MFE solutions exactly match the local solutions. It is due to the fact that in this case, the nonlocal bending moment M is thoroughly equal to the equilibrium bending moment M
                        
                           E
                         which is the linear function. It is clearly noted from Eq. (11) that the nonlocal effect would be eliminated when M is the linear function. However, for 
                           
                              
                                 α
                              
                              
                                 2
                              
                           
                           ≠
                           1
                        , the nonlocal bending moment M has an interruption point at the location of point load. As a result, one can see that the deformation abruptly changes at the location of applied load for

                           0
                        . It is worth noting that the MFE solutions for

                         exactly match the solutions from Wang and Liew [32] which are obtained by adding the point load effect concerning the Dirac delta function into the governing equation.

                         and RFE solutions are independent of nonlocal parameter

                        . The RFE solutions are obtained by following the procedure of Phadikar and Pradhan [35]. For

                           0
                        , the obtained results somewhat differ from those of Reddy [29] and Aydogdu [31] which accounted for the point load effect by transforming point load into the distributed load by using Fourier series transformation. However, it is worth noting that this study gives the precise value when 
                           
                              
                                 e

                           0
                        . In fact, the well-known maximum deflection of the simply supported beam under point load at midpoint is 
                           w
                           =

                           EI
                        . Therefore, normalized deflection is

                         which is exactly given in Table 3. Once again, one can say that the appearance of nonlocal effect produces the increase of deflection. This phenomenon is consistent with the former example. In order to show the capacity of the mixed finite element method for the nonlocal nanobeams with arbitrary boundary conditions and loads, the static response of indeterminate two-spans continuous nonlocal nanobeam is investigated in Fig. 3
                        . Similarly, MFE solutions for

                         can capture the nonlocal effect for two-spans continuous nanobeams subjected to point loads.

In order to study further the mechanical characteristics of nanotubes, the cantilever nanobeams are considered. The important conclusion of Wang and Liew [32] for the cantilever beam model is that the nonlocal effect is vanished for the portion of beam from the clamped end to the position of applied point load. Beyond this position, the nonlocal effect immediately influences on the bending behaviour of cantilever. That leads to the puzzling fact of the nonlocal beam model in that the nonlocality does not affect the cantilever beam subjected to point load at free end. In order to overcome this confusing phenomenon, Challamel and Wang [45] introduced the so-called new nonlocal elastic beam model which is combined by the usual integral models and gradient models.

                         shows the deformation shape of cantilever beam subjected to point load P at

Therefore the nonlocal effect would be vanished for the nonlocal nanobeams subjected to point load at free end. Moreover, as point load approaches close to clamped end, the nonlocal effect leads to the impractical deformation shape which tends towards the opposite direction of the undeformed configuration.

                        2 reduces the stiffness of the beam whereas the increase of α
                        1 leads to the increase of the stiffness. For example, if α
                        1 is equal to 1, the present model would be stiffer than the classical solution when α
                        2 is in the range from 0 to 1 as shown in Fig. 7. Similarly, the variation of the ratio

                        1 in the range from 0 to 0.5, the present model is softer than the classical local model while the present model is stiffer than the classical local model for α

Finally, from solutions of the nonlocal cantilever beam subjected to intermediate point load and uniform load, as a result, we hopefully deduce that the static responses of the nonlocal cantilever beam could be adjusted to describe the results from the experiments or other models of cantilever nanobeams by determining the coefficients α
                        1 and α
                        2.

Salvetat et al. [53] performed the experiment of clamped beam model to measure the elastic and shear moduli of single-wall nanotubes. The static responses of clamped beam were exploited to achieve this goal. In this example, bending behaviour of the nonlocal clamped beam is investigated. The deflection of the clamped beam under the intermediate point load at

In Fig. 10
                        , the deflections of the clamped beam subjected to uniform load are plotted. It is easy to see that the coefficient α
                        2 has no effect on the result due to the absence of concentrated load. It is quite confusing that the nonlocality does not influence on the MFE solution for

                         which is different with the solution of the nonlocal cantilever beam. This result of the clamped beam was also reported in the study by Wang et al. [25]. Because of

                         which is the quadratic function. Therefore, it is reasonable that the nonlocal effect should exist in Eq. (11). For this case, it is predicted that the symmetrical characteristics of the bending moment cause this puzzling phenomenon. Indeed, let us consider the clamped beam subjected to uniform load q for the half and uniform load

                           q
                         for the remaining part as shown in Fig. 11. In this case, the bending moment is not only the quadratic function but also asymmetric. It is easy to see that the MFE solution for

                         differs with the local counterpart. In contrast, the above contradiction does not exist for

                        . Additionally, as mentioned for the cantilever beam, we expectantly predict that the response of the nonlocal clamped beam could be adapted to represent the experimental result of clamped nanobeam by adjusting the coefficients α
                        1 and α
                        2

@&#CONCLUSIONS@&#

Presented herein is the mixed finite element method for the static analysis of nonlocal Euler–Bernoulli nanobeams. This is the first attempt to develop the numerical method to solve the point load problem of beam considering nonlocal theory. The mixed finite element method with only Lagrange linear interpolation for Euler–Bernoulli beam theory can manage to consider the nonlocal effect for the point load problem of nonlocal beam. The numerical results are calculated and compared for typical boundary conditions as well as complex boundary conditions and loadings. Throughout the numerical results, it is implied that the nonlocal effect could manifest itself for all kinds of boundary conditions and loadings by adjusting two coefficients α
                     1 and α
                     2 for nonlocal bending moment. The important observations are summarized as follows:
                        
                           1.
                           The nonlocal effect induces the abrupt change on deflection of nonlocal beam at the location of point load.

The coefficient α
                              1 has no effect for the simply supported boundary condition where the equilibrium bending moment is equal to zero. Similarly, the coefficient α
                              2 has no effect for nanobeams subjected to uniform load.

By determining two coefficients α
                              1 and α
                              2, the MFE solutions could be adjusted to overcome some contradiction phenomena of the nonlocal nanobeam such as cantilever beam subjected to point load at free end or near clamped end, and the clamped beam subjected to uniform load. Moreover, the symmetrical characteristics maybe causes the vanishing of nonlocal effect for the clamped beam subjected to uniform load.
