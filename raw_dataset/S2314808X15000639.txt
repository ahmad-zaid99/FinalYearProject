Double fuzzy topology

(r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets

(r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets

@&#ABSTRACT@&#


                  The purpose of this paper is to introduce and study a new class of fuzzy sets called (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets and (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces. Furthermore, the relationships between the new concepts are introduced and established with some interesting examples.
               

@&#INTRODUCTION@&#

A progressive development of fuzzy sets [1] has been made to discover the fuzzy analogues of the crisp sets theory. On the other hand, the idea of intuitionistic fuzzy sets was first introduced by Atanassov [2]. Later on, Çoker [3] presented the notion of intuitionistic fuzzy topology. Samanta and Mondal [4], introduced and characterized the intuitionistic gradation of openness of fuzzy sets which is a generalization of smooth topology and the topology of intuitionistic fuzzy sets. The name “intuitionistic” is discontinued in mathematics and applications. Garcia and Rodabaugh [5] concluded that they work under the name “double”.

In 2009, Omari and Noorani [6] introduced generalized b-closed sets (briefly, gb-closed) in general topology. As a generalization of the results in References 6 and 7, we introduce and study (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets in double fuzzy topological spaces, then a new class of fuzzy sets between an (r, s)-fuzzy b-closed sets and an (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed sets namely (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets is introduced and investigated. Finally, the relationships between (r, s)-generalized fuzzy b-closed and (r, s)-generalized ⋆-fuzzy b-closed sets are introduced and established with some interesting counter examples.

Throughout this paper, X will be a non-empty set, I = [0, 1], I
                     0 = (0, 1] and I
                     1 = [0, 1). A fuzzy set λ is quasi-coincident with a fuzzy set µ (denoted by, λqµ) iff there exists x ∈ X such that

Now, we recall the following definitions which are useful in the sequel.
                        Definition 2.1
                        (see [4]) A double fuzzy topology (τ, τ*) on X is a pair of maps τ, τ* : IX
                            → I, which satisfies the following properties:

The triplet (X, τ, τ*) is called a double fuzzy topological space (briefly, dfts). A fuzzy set λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy open (briefly, (r, s)-fo) if τ(λ) ≥ r and τ*(λ) ≤ s. A fuzzy set λ is called an (r, s)-fuzzy closed (briefly, (r, s)-fc) set iff

                           λ
                        
                      is an (r, s)-fo set.
                        Theorem 2.1
                        (see [8]) Let (X, τ, τ*) be a dfts. Then double fuzzy closure operator and double fuzzy interior operator of λ ∈ IX

                           1. But

Therefore

                                 λ

Hence λ is an (r, s)-fbc set.

(2) Suppose that λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc and ν is an (r, s)-gfo set in IX

                     0 and s ∈ I
                     1. So λ ≤ ν. But we have, λ is an (r, s)-g ⋆fbc, then

The following implication illustrates the relationships between different fuzzy sets:
                        
                           
                        
                     
                  

None of these implications is reversible where A → B represents A implies B, as shown by the following examples. But at this stage we do not have information regarding the relationship between an (r, s)-gfbc and (r, s)-g ⋆fc sets.
