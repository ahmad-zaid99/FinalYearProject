In Phase I, we compute each element?s top-k similar elements.
In our experiments, we used k = 20.
In our experiments, we set ?1 = 0.35.
Input: A list of elements E to be clustered, a similarity database S from Phase I, thresh olds ?1 and ?2.
A class is then defined as the maximal subhierarchy with probability less than a threshold (we used e-2).
We used Minipar 1 (Lin 1994), a broad coverage English parser, to parse about 1GB (144M words) of newspaper text from the TREC collection (1988 AP Newswire, 1989-90 LA Times, and 1991 San Jose Mercury) at a speed of about 500 words/second on a PIII-750 with 512MB memory.
We constructed two test sets: S13403 consisting of 13403 words (m = 250) and S3566 consisting of 3566 words (m = 3500).
For S13403 there are 99 classes that contain three words or less and the largest class contains 3246 words.
For S3566, 78 classes have three or less words and the largest class contains 1181 words.
Test set S3566 has a higher score for all algorithms because it has a higher number of average features per word than S13403.
For the K-means and Buckshot algorithms, we set the number of clusters to 250 and the maximum number of iterations to 8.
We used a sample size of 2000 for Buckshot.
For the Bisecting K-means algorithm, we applied the basic K-means algorithm twice (?= 2 in Section 2) with a maximum of 8 iterations per split.
Our implementation of Chameleon was unable to complete clustering S13403 in reasonable time due to its time complexity.
