This very simple algorithm has an error rate of about 7.9% when trained on 90% of the tagged Brown Corpus' [Francis and Kueera 82], and tested on a separate 5% of the corpus.2 Training consists of compiling a list of the most common tag for each word in the training corpus.
Patch templates are of the form: The initial tagger was trained on 90% of the corpus (the training corpus).
5% was held back to be used for the patch acquisition procedure (the patch corpus) and 5% for testing.
If the patch change the tag from verb to noun if one of the two preceding words is tagged as a determiner is applied, it corrects 98 of the 159 errors.
First, tag the text using the basic lexical tagger.
The tagger was tested on 5% of the Brown Corpus including sections from every genre.
First, the test corpus was tagged by the simple lexical tagger.
It is significant that with only 71 patches, an error rate of 5.1% was obtained'.
Of the 71 patches, 66 resulted in a reduction in the number of errors in the test corpus, 3 resulted in no net change, and 2 resulted in a higher number of errors.
91], an error rate of 3-4% on one domain, Wall Street Journal articles and 5.6% on another domain, texts on terrorism in Latin American countries, is quoted.
[Church 88] reports an accuracy of &quot;95-99% correct, depending on the definition of correct&quot;.
When trained and tested on the same samples used in our experiment, we found the error rate to be about 4.5%.
[DeRose 88] quotes a 4% error rate; however, the sample used for testing was part of the training corpus.
87] reports an accuracy of 96-97%.
This procedure, which requires that a list of idioms be laboriously created by hand, contributes 3% toward the accuracy of their tagger, according to [DeRose 88].
