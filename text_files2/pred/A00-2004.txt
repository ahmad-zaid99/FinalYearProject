Our segmentation algorithm takes a list of tokenized sentences as input.
A tokenizer (Grefenstette and Tapanainen, 1994) and a sentence boundary disambiguation algorithm (Palmer and Hearst, 1994; Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997) or EAGLE (Reynar et al., 1997) may be used to convert a plain text document into the acceptable input format.
Punctuation and uninformative words are removed from each sentence using a simple regular expression pattern matcher and a stopword list.
A stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980) is then applied to the remaining tokens to obtain the word stems.
Thus, in the context of text segmentation where a segment has typically < 100 informative tokens, one can only use the metric to estimate the order of similarity between sentences, e.g.
Figure 2 shows an example of image ranking using a 3 x 3 rank mask with output range {0, 8).
For segmentation, we used a 11 x 11 rank mask.
The output is expressed as a ratio r (equation 2) to circumvent normalisation problems (consider the cases when the rank mask is not contained in the image).
r(x) is the rank (1 x 11 mask) of (x) which is a sine wave with decaying mean, amplitude and frequency (equation 3).
An unusually large reduction in 6D suggests the optiinal clustering has been obtained3 (see n = 10 in the threshold, p+c x to dD (c= 1.2 works well in practice) The running time of each step is dominated by the computation of sk.
Our evaluation strategy is a variant of that described in (Reynar, 1998, 71-73) and the TDT segmentation task (Allan et al., 1998).
Low error probability indicates high accuracy.
We consider the status of in potential boundaries as a bit string (1 -4 topic boundary).
The terms p(iniss) awl p(fa) in equation 6 corresponds to p(samelk) and p(difflk) = 1 -p(samelk).
Equation 7, 8 and 9 gives the general form of p(samelk), B(r,?)
Given the co-occurrence frequencies f (wi, wi), the transition probability matrix t is computed by equation 10.
Both algorithms used a 11 x 11 ranking mask.
The second experiment investigates the effect of different ranking mask size on the performance of C99 (table 7).
Execution time increases with mask size.
A 1 x 1 ranking mask reduces all the elements in the rank matrix to zero.
Interestingly, the increase in ranking mask size beyond 3 x 3 has insignificant effect on segmentation accuracy.
C99, K98 and R98 are all polynomial time algorithms.
