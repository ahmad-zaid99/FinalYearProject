embedding the clusters in an application and using its evaluation measure.
An example of the second approach evaluates the clusters by using them to smooth probability distributions (Lee and Pereira 1999).
To extract classes from WordNet, we first estimate the probability of a random word belonging to a subhierarchy (a synset and its hyponyms).
We use the frequency counts of synsets in the SemCor corpus (Landes, Leacock, Tengi 1998) to estimate the probability of a subhierarchy.
A class is then defined as the maximal subhierarchy with probability less than a threshold (we used e-2).
We used Minipar 1 (Lin 1994), a broad coverage English parser, to parse about 1GB (144M words) of newspaper text from the TREC collection (1988 AP Newswire, 1989-90 LA Times, and 1991 San Jose Mercury) at a speed of about 500 words/second on a PIII-750 with 512MB memory.
We constructed two test sets: S13403 consisting of 13403 words (m = 250) and S3566 consisting of 3566 words (m = 3500).
For S13403 there are 99 classes that contain three words or less and the largest class contains 3246 words.
For S3566, 78 classes have three or less words and the largest class contains 1181 words.

For the K-means and Buckshot algorithms, we set the number of clusters to 250 and the maximum number of iterations to 8.
For the Bisecting K-means algorithm, we applied the basic K-means algorithm twice (?= 2 in Section 2) with a maximum of 8 iterations per split.
