Our method for Base NP translation comprises of two steps: translation candidate collection and translation selection.
In translation candidate collection, we look for translation candidates of a given Base NP.
In translation selection, we find out possible translation(s) from the translation candidates.
In this paper, we confine ourselves to translation of noun-noun pairs from English to Chinese; our method, however, can be extended to translations of other types of Base NPs between other language pairs.
3.1 Translation Candidate Collection.
We use heuristics for translation candidate collection.
Figure 1 illustrates the process of collecting Chinese translation candidates for an English Base NP ?information age?
with the heuristics.

Translation candidate collection 3.2 Translation Selection --.
EM-NBC-Ensemble We view the translation selection problem as that of classification and employ EM-NBC-Ensemble to perform the task.
For the ease of explanation, we first describe the algorithm of using only EM-NBC and next extend it to that of using EM-NBC-Ensemble.
Basic Algorithm Let e~ denote the Base NP to be translated and C~ the set of its translation candidates (phrases).
Suppose that kC =|~| . Let c~ represent a random variable on C~ . Let E denote a set of words in English, and C a set of words in Chinese.
Suppose that nCmE == ||and|| . Let e represent a random variable on E and c a random variable on C. Figure 2 describes the algorithm.

Output: the top sorted results Figure 2.
Algorithm of EM-NBC-Ensemble Context Information As input data, we use ?contexts?
in English which contain the phrase to be translated.
We also use contexts in Chinese which contain the translation candidates.
Here, a context containing a phrase is defined as the surrounding words within a window of a predetermined size, which window covers the phrase.
We can easily obtain the data by searching for them on the web.
Actually, the contexts containing the candidates are obtained at the same time when we conduct translation candidate collection (Step 4 in Figure 1).
EM Algorithm We define a relation between E and C as CER ??
, which represents the links in a translation dictionary.
We further define }),(|{ Rceec ?=?
At Step 1, we assume that all the instances in ))(),..,(),(( 21 mefefef are independently generated according to the distribution defined as: ? ?
= Cc cePcPeP )|()()( (1) We estimate the parameters of the distribution by using the Expectation and Maximization (EM) Algorithm (Dempster et al, 1977).
Initially, we set for all Cc ? || 1)( C cP = , ??
?= c c c e e ceP if,0 if,|| 1 )|( Next, we estimate the parameters by iteratively updating them, until they converge (cf., Figure 3).
Finally, we calculate )(cf E for all Cc ? as:?
= Ee E efcPcf )()()( (2) In this way, we can transform the frequency vector in English ))(),..,(),(( 21 mefefef into a vector in Chinese ))(),..,(),(( 21 nEEE cfcfcf=D . Prior Probability Estimation At Step 2, we approximately estimate the prior probability )~(cP by using the document frequencies of the translation candidates.
The data are obtained when we conduct candidate collection (Step 4 in Figure 1).

EM Algorithm EM-NBC At Step 2, we use an EM-based Na?ve Bayesian Classifier (EM-NBC) to select the candidates c~ whose posterior probabilities are the largest: ??)~|(log)()~(logmaxarg )|~(maxarg ~ ~ ~ ~ ccPcfcP cP Cc E Cc Cc D (3) Equation (3) is based on Bayes?rule and the assumption that the data in D are independently generated from CcccP ?),~|( . In our implementation, we use an equivalent ??)~|(log)()~(logminarg ~ ~ ccPcfcP Cc E Cc ?(4) where 1??is an additional parameter used to emphasize the prior information.
If we ignore the first term in Equation (4), then the use of one EM-NBC turns out to select the candidate whose frequency vector is the closest to the transformed vector D in terms of KL divergence (cf., Cover and Tomas 1991).
EM-NBC-Ensemble To further improve performance, we use an ensemble (i.e., a linear combination) of EM-NBCs (EM-NBC-Ensemble), while the classifiers are constructed on the basis of the data in different contexts with different window sizes.
More specifically, we calculate where s),1,(i, L=iD denotes the data in different contexts.
3.3 Translation Selection -- EM-TF-IDF.
We view the translation selection problem as that of calculating similarities between context vectors and use as context vectors TF-IDF vectors constructed with the EM Algorithm.
Figure 4 describes the algorithm in which we use the same notations as those in EM-NBC-Ensemble.
The idf value of a Chinese word c is calculated in advance and as )/)(log()( Fcdfcidf ?= (6) where )cdf( denotes the document frequency of c and F the total document frequency.

Algorithm of EM-TF-IDF 3.4 Advantage of Using EM Algorithm.
The uses of EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF can be viewed as extensions of existing methods for word or phrase translation using non-parallel corpora.
Particularly, the use of the EM Algorithm can help to accurately transform a frequency vector from one language to another.
Suppose that we are to determine if ?
is a translation of ?information age?
(actually it is).
The frequency vectors of context words for ?information age?
and ?
are given in A and D in Figure 5, respectively.
If for each English word we only retain the link connecting to the Chinese translation with the largest frequency (a link represented as a solid line) to establish a many-to-one mapping and transform vector A from English to Chinese, we obtain vector B. It turns out, however, that vector B is quite different from vector D, although they should be similar to each other.
We will refer to this method as ?Major Translation?
hereafter.
With EM, vector A in Figure 5 is transformed into vector C, which is much closer to vector D, as expected.
Specifically, EM can split the frequency of a word in English and distribute them into its translations in Chinese in a theoretically sound way (cf., the distributed frequencies of ?internet?).
Note that if we assume a many-to-one (or one-to-one) mapping ? = = s i icP s cP 1 )|~(1)|~( DD (5) relationship, then the use of EM turns out to be equivalent to that of Major Translation.
3.5 Combination.
In order to further boost the performance of translation, we propose to also use the translation method proposed in Nagata et al Specifically, we combine our method with that of Nagata et alby using a back-off strategy.
Figure 6 illustrates the process of collecting Chinese translation candidates for an English Base NP ?information asymmetry?
with Nagata et al?s method.
In the combination of the two methods, we first use Nagata et als method to perform translation; if we cannot find translations, we next use our method.
We will denote this strategy ?Back-off?.
We conducted experiments on translation of the Base NPs from English to Chinese.
We extracted Base NPs (noun-noun pairs) from the Encarta 1 English corpus using the tool developed by Xun et al(2000).
There were about 1 http://encarta.msn.com/Default.asp 3000 Base NPs extracted.
In the experiments, we.used the HIT English-Chinese word translation dictionary2 . The dictionary contains about 76000 Chinese words, 60000 English words, and 118000 translation links.
As a web search engine, we used Google (http://www.google.com).
Five translation experts evaluated the translation results by judging whether or not they were acceptable.
The evaluations reported below are all based on their judgements.
4.1 Basic Experiment.
In the experiment, we randomly selected 1000 Base NPs from the 3000 Base NPs.
We next used our method to perform translation on the 1000 phrases.
In translation selection, we employed EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF.
Table 1.
Best translation result for each method Accuracy (%) Top 1 Top 3 Coverage (%) EM-NBC-Ensemble 61.7 80.3 Prior 57.6 77.6 MT-NBC-Ensemble 59.9 78.1 EM-KL-Ensemble 45.9 72.3 EM-NBC 60.8 78.9 EM-TF-IDF 61.9 80.8 MT-TF-IDF 58.2 77.6 EM-TF 55.8 77.8 89.9 Table 1 shows the results in terms of coverage and top n accuracy.
Here, coverage is defined as the percentage of phrases which have translations selected, while top n accuracy is defined as the percentage of phrases whose selected top n translations include correct translations.
For EM-NBC-Ensemble, we set the ? !in (4) to be 5 on the basis of our preliminary experimental results.
For EM-TF-IDF, we used the non-web data described in Section 4.4 to estimate idf values of words.
We used contexts with window sizes of ?1, ?3, ?5, ?7, ?9, ?11.

Translation results Figure 7 shows the results of EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF, in which for EM-NBC-Ensemble ?window size?
denotes that of the largest within an ensemble.
Table 1 summarizes the best results for each of them.
?Prior?
and ?MT-TF-IDF?
are actually baseline methods relying on the existing technologies.
In Prior, we select candidates whose prior probabilities are the largest, equivalently, document frequencies obtained in translation candidate collection are the largest.
In MT-TF-IDF, we use TF-IDF vectors transformed with Major Translation.
Our experimental results indicate that both EM-NBC-Ensemble and EM-TF-IDF significantly outperform Prior and MT-TF-IDF, when appropriate window sizes are chosen.
The p-values of the sign tests are 0.00056 and 0.00133 for EM-NBC-Ensemble, 0.00002 and 0.00901 for EM-TF-IDF, respectively.
We next removed each of the key components of EM-NBC-Ensemble and used the remaining components as a variant of it to perform translation selection.
The key components are (1) distance calculation by KL divergence (2) EM, (3) prior probability, and (4) ensemble.
The variants, thus, respectively make use of (1) the baseline method ?Prior?, (2) an ensemble of Na?ve Bayesian Classifiers based on Major Translation (MT-NBC-Ensemble), (3) an ensemble of EM-based KL divergence calculations (EM-KL-Ensemble), and (4) EM-NBC.
Figure 7 and Table 1 show the results.
We see that EM-NBC-Ensemble outperforms all of the variants, indicating that all the components within EM-NBC-Ensemble play positive roles.
We removed each of the key components of EM-TF-IDF and used the remaining components as a variant of it to perform translation selection.
The key components are (1) idf value and (2) EM.
The variants, thus, respectively make use of (1) EM-based frequency vectors (EM-TF), (2) the baseline method MT-TF-IDF.
Figure 7 and Table 1 show the results.
We see that EM-TF-IDF outperforms both variants, indicating that all of the components within EM-TF-IDF are needed.
Comparing the results between MT-NBC-Ensemble and EM-NBC-Ensemble and the results between MT-TF-IDF and EM-TF-IDF, we see that the uses of the EM Algorithm can indeed help to improve translation accuracies.

We analyzed the reasons for incorrect translations and found that the incorrect translations were due to: (1) no existence of dictionary entry (19%), (2) non-compositional translation (13%), (3) ranking error (68%).
4.2 Our Method vs. Nagata et als Method.
Table 3.
Translation results Accuracy (%) Top 1 Top 3 Coverage (%) Our Method 61.7 80.3 89.9 Nagata et als 72.0 76.0 10.5 We next used Nagata et als method to perform translation.
From Table 3, we can see that the accuracy of Nagata et als method is higher than that of our method, but the coverage of it is lower.
The results indicate that our proposed Back-off strategy for translation is justifiable.
4.3 Combination.
In the experiment, we tested the Back-off strategy, Table 4 shows the results.
The Back-off strategy Table 4.
Translation results Accuracy% Top 1 Top 3 Coverage % Back-off (Ensemble) 62.9 79.7 Back-off (TF-IDF) 62.2 79.8 91.4 helps to further improve the results whether EM-NBC-Ensemble or EM-TF-IDF is used.
4.4 Web Data vs. Non-web Data.
To test the effectiveness of the use of web data, we conducted another experiment in which we performed translation by using non-web data.
The data comprised of the Wall Street Journal corpus in English (1987-1992, 500MB) and the People?s Daily corpus in Chinese (1982-1998, 700MB).
We followed the Back-off strategy as in Section 4.3 to translate the 1000 Base NPs.

For Nagata et al?s method, we found that it was almost impossible to find partial-parallel corpora in the non-web data.
