In this case, Nominator consults a small authority file which contains information on about 3000 special 'name words' and their relevant lexical features.
Also listed are exception words, such as upper-case lexical items that are unlikely to be single-word proper names (e.g., Very, I or TV) and lower-case lexical items (e.g., and and van) that can be parts of proper names.
In addition, the authority file contains about 20,000 first names.
The precision and recall of Nominator, operating without a database of pre-existing proper names, is in the 90's while the processing rate is over 40Mg of text per hour on a RISC/6000 machine.
A linguist manually identified 2426 occurrences of proper names, which reduced to 1354 unique tokens.
Of these, Nominator correctly identified the boundaries of 91% (1230/1354).
The precision rate was 92% for the 1409 names Nominator identified (1230/1409).
In terms of semantic disambiguation, Nominator failed to assign an entity type to 21% of the names it identified.
The payoff of this choice is a very high precision rate &#8212; 99% &#8212; for the assignment of semantic type to those names that were disambiguated.
