ALEK was tested on 20 words.
To build the usage model for each target word, 10,000 sentences containing it were extracted from the North American News Corpus.
As in the development system, the model of general English was based on bigram and trigram frequencies of function words and part-ofspeech tags from 30-million words of the San Jose Mercury News.
The size of the test set for each word ranged from 1,400 to 20,000 with a mean of 8,000 sentences.
To evaluate the system, for each test word we randomly extracted 125 sentences that ALEK classified as containing no error (C-set) and 125 sentences which it labeled as containing an error (E-set).
The human judge marked as incorrect usage 91.2% of the sample from ALEK's E-set and 18.4% of the sample from its C-set.
The E-set contained 8.3% of the pollution sentences and the C-set had the remaining 91.7%.
With the human judgements as the gold standard, the estimated overall rate of incorrect usage is (.083 x .912 + .917 x .184) = .245.
The performance for concentrate showed overall precision of 0.89 and recall of 0.07.
For interest, precision was 0.85 with recall of 0.11.
In sentences containing knowledge, precision was 0.99 and recall was 0.30.
This system was tested on 79 sentences containing determiner and agreement errors, and 101 grammatical sentences.
We calculate that their precision was 78% with 54% recall.
