The object complement OPCOMPL-0 is linked to the verb readings having the subcategorisation SVOC.
The sentence is thus disambiguated both morphologically and morphosyntactically, and a syntactic phosyntactic alternatives, e.g. whatever is ambiguous in 10 ways.
The PC has a Pentium 90 MHz processor and 16 MB of memory.
The speed roughly corresponds to 200 words in second.
In addition, both systems use the front parts of the ENGCG system for processing the input.
These include the tokeniser, lexical analyser and morphological disambiguator.
A similar measure is used in (Eisner, 1996) except that every word has a head, i.e. the precision equals recall, reported as 79.2%.
It seems the parser leaves some amount of the words unlinked (e.g. 10-15% of subjects) but what it has recognised is generally correct (precision 95-98% for subjects).
Dekang Lin (1996) has earlier used this kind of evaluation, where precision and recall were for subjects 87% and 78%, and for complements (including objects) 84% and 72 %, respectively.
