Although mathematically the model predicts tree elements in a top-down fashion, we search the space bottom-up using a chartbased search.
Our system for MUC-7 consisted of the sentential model described in this paper, coupled with a simple probability model for cross-sentence merging.
In both Template Entity (TE) and Template Relation (TR), our system finished in second place among all entrants.
Nearly all of the work was done by the sentential model; disabling the cross-sentence model entirely reduced our overall F-Score by only 2 points.
We evaluated part-of-speech tagging and parsing accuracy on the Wall Street Journal using a now standard procedure (see Collins 97), and evaluated name finding accuracy on the MUC7 named entity test.
