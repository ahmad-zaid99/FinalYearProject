This representation has the following salient features: Lexemes which are in the lexicon are in uppercase, those that are not are in lowercase.
>Also, REALPRO does not map any sort of semantic labels to syntactic categories.
The architecture of REALPRO is based on MeaningText Theory, which posits a sequence of correspondences between different levels of representation.
In REALPRO, each transformation is handled by a separate module.
Each module draws on one or several LKBs.
The average runtime for this input is 0.31 seconds, which is comparable to the runtime reported above for the 20 word sentence.
The current grammar does not have any rules with more than three nodes.
