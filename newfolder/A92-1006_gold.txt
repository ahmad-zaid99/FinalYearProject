Once the sentence planner has constructed the DSyntR of a complete sentence, it sends it to the realizer which generates the English sentence.
We therefore found McKeown's schema-based approach (McKeown 1985) to be the most promising.
It receives propositions from the text planner and sends the DSyntR of complete sentences to the realizer for processing.
It has two main tasks: first, it chooses lexical and syntactic realizations by consulting the Conceptual/English dictionary; second, it determines sentence scope by merging the DSyntR of individual propositions.
Each proposition is mapped into the DSyntR of a clause (i.e., its root is a verb).
Each incoming proposition is translated into a DSyntR, which the sentence planner then attempts to merge with the current DSyntR.
If none of the clause combination strategies work, or if stylistic heuristics interfere, or if the incoming proposition is a conceptual-break, the current DSyntR is sent to the realizer and the new DSyntR becomes the current one.
