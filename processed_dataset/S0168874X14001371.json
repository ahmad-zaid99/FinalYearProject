KEYPHRASES   Finite element analysis  Soil\u2013blade contact modeling  Blade force   According to [1], about half of energy used for crop production in farming is consumed by tillage operation because of high draft force generated when breaking and loosening of the soil occur. Most soil\u2013blade interaction research [2] were focused on developing models to predict the draft force for different soil conditions, tool geometry, and operating parameters such as depth of operation, tool direction, etc. Rather significant effects of these conditions and parameters on the force prediction have been demonstrated experimentally in several research works [3\u20136].  Analytical considerations of soil\u2013blade interaction are typically restricted to straight blades and are based on a simplified limit analysis. Nevertheless, when combined with experimental findings, they are widely used in design. The resulting formulas defining forces on blades during tillage operation can be found in [7] for two dimensional problems, and in [8] for three dimensional problems.  The blade shape obviously affects the form and size of the soil failure zone and consequently forces on the blade. Therefore, blades of more complicated geometries should be considered in optimization of the tillage operation. In particular, it is known that curved blades work better than straight blades. However, as already mentioned, any prediction of forces using analytical models would be limited to only a straight rectangular blade shape, and therefore not particularly useful in improving efficiency of tillage operations.  The FE method has obviously a potential of modeling the interaction between soil and blades of arbitrary shapes and to find the blade force during this interaction. Also, such techniques can be used to obtain information about the failure zone, field of stress, soil deformation, acting forces, etc. for any condition of soil. Several models based on FE to simulate soil\u2013tool interaction and to obtain response of tools during these interactions have been presented in [9\u201318].  Two major challenges to be considered in the FE approach are the mechanical behavior of soil and the criteria for soil separation due to the cutting action of the blade [19]. Several models were proposed for simulating the constitutive law for soil; one of them is the Drucker\u2013Prager model that assumes a non-associated elastic plastic behavior [1]. From the numerical viewpoint soil separation is somewhat similar to the problem of cutting chips in machining operations [20\u201322], where various geometrical and physical separation criteria were developed based on critical values of displacements, strains, stresses, or strain energy to estimate the beginning of separation. A new criterion that uses the limit compacting strains in the direction of cutting is proposed here. When using this criterion to the FE model the soil particles are separated \u2018discretely\u2019 at consecutive nodes starting from the node that is nearest to the cutting edge of the blade.  The overall objective of this research work is to develop a simulation procedure for modeling the soil\u2013tool interaction for arbitrary shape of the blade. Here the proposed procedure is tested on the straight blades in order to compare it with available analytical/experimental results [7\u20138]. In particular, the use of contact elements, modeling sliding and cutting as the blade moves through the soil is explained in detail, as well as the method of calculating the draft force for the separation process that in fact takes place discretely at successive nodes.  The soil selected for this study is the type of soil commonly found in Saskatchewan. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, theoretical background and FE modeling is explained, Section 3 provides results and discussion, and Section 4 is the conclusion.  In this section, first the plasticity based constitutive law for soil is briefly outlined. Then the FE modeling and handling of the soil\u2013blade interaction is explained. In particular, the procedure of simulating the cutting process (which is continuous) through the soil (described by a discrete FE mesh) is discussed in more details.  The material behavior in the theory of plasticity is governed by the yielding function (or the yield criterion) and the plastic flow rule typically derived from the plastic potential. If the plastic potential is the same as the yield function, then the plastic flow rule is called associated, with the increments of plastic strains normal to the yield surface. Otherwise, the flow rule is called non-associated with the direction of increments of plastic strains normal to the surface representing the plastic potential, but not to the yield function.  Drucker\u2013Prager and Mohr\u2013Coulomb are the two most commonly used failure criteria for soil in a plastic stress\u2013strain region. There is a main difference between these two criteria which makes Drucker\u2013Prager a preferred criterion in soil analysis: the Mohr\u2013Coulomb criterion is difficult to use for plastic finite element analysis in 3D, since it is not a smooth continuous function, and has several sharp corners. On the other hand, the Drucker\u2013Prager criterion has a conical surface in 3D and has smooth surface which is more suitable to be used.  The Drucker\u2013Prager yield function (also referred to as extended/modified Drucker\u2013Prager criteria, for example in [23]) is pressure dependent, which makes it applicable for geotechnical materials. It can be expressed as follows:  (1)  f ( \u03c3 ) = \u03b2   I   1   +     J   2     \u2212 k = 0   where k and \u03b2 are material constants, and   I   1   is the first invariant of the stress tensor (also   I   1   = 3   \u03c3   m   , where   \u03c3   m   is mean or hydrostatic pressure) while   J   2   is the second invariant of the stress deviator tensor defined using the principal stresses (   \u03c3   1   ,    \u03c3   2   ,    \u03c3   3   ) as follows:  (2)    I   1   =   \u03c3   1   +   \u03c3   2   +   \u03c3   3        (3)    J   2   =   1 6   [   (   \u03c3   1   \u2212   \u03c3   2   )  2  +   (   \u03c3   1   \u2212   \u03c3   3   )  2  +   (   \u03c3   3   \u2212   \u03c3   2   )  2  ]   For soil the constants k and \u03b2 are defined in terms of c and \u03d5 , the soil cohesion and the angle of internal friction respectively, as  (4)  k =   6 c  cos  \u03d5    3  ( 3 \u2212  sin  \u03d5 )        (5)  \u03b2 =   2  sin  \u03d5    3  ( 3 \u2212  sin  \u03d5 )     The values of c and \u03d5 can be determined from triaxial test, in which the maximum shear stress \u03c4 \u2032 in the presence of normal stress \u03c3 \u2032 is recorded and graphed as sketched in Fig. 1. The stresses \u03c4 \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032 , which are shown in the inset, are often related to the minimum and maximum principal stresses (   \u03c3   1   and   \u03c3   3   respectively) via 2D stress transformations. In our case these stresses will typically be in the plane of the blade\u05f3s motion. The limit values of \u03c4 \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032 , which are usually related linearly, can be interpreted as     J   2     and \u2212   I   1   respectively. The direction of inelastic sliding \u03b8 is dependent on the internal friction through the relationship \u03b8 \u2248   45  \u2218  \u2212 \u03d5 / 2 . It should be noticed that the thick-solid line represents the yield criterion (1) for the mean stress in compression.  In this research, the soil\u2013blade interaction is modeled by the Drucker\u2013Prager criteria with a non-associate flow rule controlled by the value of dilatancy angle \u03bd , which represents the volumetric expansion and frictional-dilatancy behavior of the material. If there is no volumetric expansion, then \u03bd = 0 (shear type of deformation only), which corresponds the direction 3 (vertical) of the increments of plastic strain. On the other hand, for the flow rule associated with criterion (1) the increments of plastic strains would have direction 1 that contains shear deformation and dilatations characterized by the dilatancy angle \u03bd = \u03d5 . According to [19] for real materials angle \u03bd is usually less than \u03d5 and should be within the limits 0 < \u03bd < \u03d5 as indicated by direction 2 (the values of parameters used in the paper are listed in Table 1).  In the numerical analysis with the external load increasing a typical material behavior defined by this law is plotted with dotted curve. It starts with elastic deformations until the yield criterion is reached and then the curve lines up with the yield surface (points   T   i   are on this surface). Plastic deformations generated along the yield surface may be considered as compacting.  It should be noted that the yield criterion is not related to separation, which should be defined independently (but the stresses must be on the yield surface for the separation to happen). Since the separation status in FE can only be defined at nodes, the simulated separation process is \u2018discrete\u2019 in this sense that there would be some stress relieve when the status at a particular node is changed from initially connected to separated. For example if just before the first separation the stress state is defined by   T   1   then just after separation it will be lowered and back in the elastic region. In this region the highest stress state, defined by   B   1   , will be typically at the opening\u05f3s tip, i.e., at the node to be separated next. Then after a further load increase (controlled here by the forced blade\u05f3s displacement) the stress state is observed at the node that would separate next. This stress state must first reach the yield surface again and then followed it until arriving at point   T   2   where the separation criterion is met again. After separating at the subsequent node the stress state drops to   B   2   , and so on (points   B   1   ,   B   2   .. are further interpreted and discussed in Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 and shown in Figs. 6 and 7). Therefore in the FE analysis the constitutive law for soil being cut is represented to be a line coinciding with the yield line and elastic \u2018incisions\u2019 inwards (   T   1     B   1   in Fig. 1). This elastic line is representing separation at the consecutive nodal point. More details of the separation procedure are explained in the next section after the geometry of the FE model and the separation surfaces are presented.  As mentioned in Section 1, the type of soil used in this research is sandy clay loam soil, which is commonly found in Saskatchewan farms. The soil behavior and subsequent modeling will depend on the soil properties; however the effects of soil volume changes cannot be neglected. As mentioned in [24], based on relative motion among soil particle during soil deformation, volumetric changes should be considered for soil modeling and any prediction of soil behavior. In FE modeling, this volume change behavior is controlled by the dilatancy angle which varies by soil density and its packing pressure. The typical range of dilatancy angle for granular soil is between 12\u00b0 and \u221220\u00b0 [25]. As shown in Table 1, in this research paper based on high density of soil and low packing pressure, the dilatancy angle is set at 20\u00b0.  The properties of soil as given by [26] and steel blade that are used in this study are listed in Table 1. The elastic\u2013plastic behavior of soil is completely defined by cohesion, internal friction angle, dilatancy angle, modulus of elasticity, specific weight, and Poisson\u05f3s ratio. It should be mentioned that the water content has a significant effect on the soil cohesion which results from electrostatic bonds between soil particles. By increasing water content of soil, lubricating effect of moisture layers on soil particles increases, which will result in decreasing particular tensile resistance, and consequently decreasing soil cohesion [27]. The results will be affected by changing the properties of soil especially cohesion and internal friction angle and would be different if the values were different.  In the FE general 3D model both soil and blade are represented by the hexahedral elements SOLID45 from the ANSYS [23] library of elements, which have 8 nodes and 3 degree of freedoms (DOF) at each node. The soil\u2013blade connection is modeled by the contact elements CONTACT173 and TARGET170 placed along the separation surfaces as discussed in the next section. The model with the elasto-plastic constitutive law, the separation procedure, and with elastic incisions (see Fig. 1) requires a relatively large number of equilibrium iterations for convergence, therefore the calculations are generally long (typically lasting several hours). Therefore a number of meshing patterns (with high mesh density near the contact areas) were tried for balancing computational effort with accuracy of calculations. The effects of the element sizes on accuracy and convergence are discussed in the section presenting the results. In general only the models that can be considered converged are shown in this study.  The so-called wide blades (with width about 10 times greater than the cutting depth) can be represented by 2-D models that obviously are much more numerically efficient and easier to interpret. In such models SOLID45 was replaced by the quadrilateral PLANE42 elements with the plane strain option, and for contact the CONTACT171 and TARGET169 elements were used. For wide blades the 2D models produced similar results as the corresponding 3D model, but at a fraction of the computational effort.  Geometry of the 3D model is sketched in Fig. 2. The model is parametric with several parameters defining the geometry of soil and tool. The soil block is L  s =300mm long, w  s =300mm wide, and d  o =150mm deep. These dimensions were selected in such a way that the solution in the vicinity of the blade is not sensitive to the block\u05f3s size. The block is divided into sub-blocks that can be meshed with different mesh densities. The maximum distance blade can travel while cutting the soil, also the length of contacts between upper and lower blocks of soil, is L  f =50mm (this dimension will be justified later). Parameter w 1 is the width of cut soil (also the width of blade), w 2 is the side width of soil block (and   w   1   + 2   w   2   =   w   s   ). The depth of cut soil is   d   1   , which is also the cutting depth of blade. Tilting of the blade with respect to the soil is defined by \u03b1, the rake angle.  The starting point of blade\u05f3s travel inside the soil block is denoted by L  e =50mm+   d   1    cos  \u03b1 . The blade\u05f3s total height is h 1=100mm. This parameter does not affect the cutting process. The ranges of d 1=25\u201350mm, w 1=20\u2013160mm, and \u03b1=30\u201390\u00b0 were examined.  In the 2D models the geometry of soil and tool was defined by identical values of   L   s   ,   L   f   and   d   s   . When comparing to 3D models the same values of   d   1   and \u03b1 were used in both models.  A typical meshing pattern is indicated in Fig. 3. Boundary conditions for such a model are as follows:  1. Bottom nodes, at Y = 0 , are fixed.  Nodes on vertical boundaries parallel to the Y\u2013X plane, at Z = 0 and Z = \u2212 ( 2   w   2   +   w   1   ) , are fixed.  Nodes on vertical boundaries parallel to the Y\u2013Z plane, at X=0 except cutting soil area are fixed.  Nodes on vertical boundaries parallel to the Y\u2013Z plane and X=L  s are fixed.  The blade is fixed in Y and Z directions in order to limit blade motion in the X direction.  The meshing shown in Fig. 3 (which can be considered typical) uses a total number of 3548 hexagonal elements and 392 contact elements. For comparison the corresponding 2D model uses 408 quadrilateral elements and 36 contact elements  The soil is in contact with the blade on four surfaces shown in Fig. 4. The soil separation takes place along surfaces 1 and 3 (the vertical cuts) and along surface 2 (the horizontal cut). These surfaces will be referred to as the separation surfaces, and the contact elements with bonding and sliding options are used to model these connections. On surface 4, however, the soil should be allowed to slide along the blade without separation. Therefore the contact elements with only sliding option should be used there. This surface will be referred to as the sliding surface.  It should be noted that the separation surfaces are parallel to the direction of the blade\u05f3s motion, while the sliding surface is parallel to the front of blade. For the numerical purposes the separation and sliding surfaces are actually modeled by two surfaces connected via the contact elements (and initially the nodes belonging to these two surfaces coincide). Such a configuration is indicated in Fig. 5 (this picture is not to scale and only the line representing the horizontal separation surface is shown). Any relative soil motion takes place on these surfaces during the soil\u2013blade interaction.  The separation process is similar to the process of cutting chips in machining operations [20\u201322] or to the crack propagation process, i.e., there is always a small crack moving in front of the blade that allows the blade to travel through the soil (such a crack can be observed on the deformation pattern shown in Fig. 8). The nodes on the separation surface can move apart if a specified separation criterion is met. The distance u traveled by the blade\u05f3s tip is measured from   L   e   , and its maximum value is   L   f   .  The elements above and below the expected separation surface are connected at nodes using the contact elements that allow to activate or deactivate the bonding forces between them. The highest stress/deformation level is observed always in the element which is at the tip of the opening and is of a particular interest during the whole simulation. At the beginning all bonding forces are active and this element (to be referred to as the tip element) is adjacent to the tip of blade. As the blade starts to move, stresses go through the elastic phase (see the broken line in Fig. 1) until the solid line representing the yielding condition (1) is reached (where the Drucker\u2013Prager plasticity rules are followed). In the tip element the strain component   \u03b5   x   (in the direction of the blade\u05f3s motion) is monitored continuously. The elasto-plastic process will continue until   \u03b5   x   reaches a predefined magnitude of   \u03b5   c   (which may be referred to as the limiting compacting strain) with the stress state reaching point   T   1   in Fig. 1. At this instant the force bonding the nodes at the opening\u05f3s tip (of the tip element) is deactivated, and the node separate generating the first opening of length equal to the size of the element\u05f3s side. This is also associated with the stresses being relieved to the state denoted by point   B   1   , which will again be inside the elastic range (i.e., inside the surface defined by the yielding condition), and a drop in the value of   \u03b5   x   below   \u03b5   c   . With the blade moving forward the stress state will be increasing to reach the yielding condition again but at the new tip of opening that is now away from the blade\u05f3s tip. The strain   \u03b5   x   will become equal to   \u03b5   c   at   T   2   and the node separate at this tip increasing the opening\u05f3s length by the size of that element and causing the stress (and strain) relieve indicated by point   B   2   , and so on.  As discussed in the next sections, the numerical experimentations indicate that for this type of soil if   \u03b5   c   \u2248 0.3 then the resultant draft force (the procedure to determine this force is discussed in the next section) was best matching the results obtained from the \u2018engineering\u2019 formulas presented in [7\u20138], and often used by the designers of tools for tillage operations. However the choice of limiting strain,   \u03b5   c   is dependent on internal friction angle. By increasing internal friction angle the value of limiting strain increases almost linearly.  Since the continuous process of cutting the soil is modeled \u2018discretely\u2019 (by disjoining consecutive nodes on the separation surface), the local stiffness in the vicinity of the opening\u05f3s tip changes abruptly with the system appearing to be slightly stiffer before the separation and slightly softer after separation. Such effects will be taken into account in the next section that presents the method of calculating the draft force required to move the blade through soil.  The separation procedure also affects how the stress state in soil follows the Drucker\u2013Prager criterion (1), which in the   \u03c3   1   ,    \u03c3   3   coordinates (i.e., in   \u03c3   min   ,    \u03c3   max   respectively and assuming   \u03c3   2   at the instant of separation) can be represented by ellipsoidal yielding curves growing or shrinking dependently on the magnitude of the current pressure. Such curves for soil are significantly affected by the internal friction \u03d5 , and generally shift towards compressive stress components.  For the case of the rake angle \u03b1 =   90  \u2218  , and for the tip element at the nodes about to be separated (i.e., corresponding to points   T   1   ,   T   2   ,   T   3   , and   T   4   in Fig. 1) such curves are plotted in Fig. 6a. Only a relatively small portion of the curves in the location A\u2013A and redrawn in Fig. 6b were used in this case. For comparison the curve for \u03d5 = 0 (independent of the pressure and intersecting the   \u03c3   1   ,    \u03c3   3   coordinates at \u00b1 2 c ) is also indicated. The figure shows some details of the stress state history for particular material points due to a continuous quasi-static motion of the blade.  For the point that initially is at the blade\u05f3s tip the history starts at Origin (no stress) and ends at   T   1   (just before the first separation). Then for the next point to separate the history starts at   B   1   (just after the first separation) and ends at   T   2   (just before the second separation, and so on).  It should be noted that the curves for the states   T   i   are in general relatively close to each other (especially in the scale shown in Fig. 6b), and are getting closer with consecutive separations. Such curves essentially coincide after about five separations indicating that the simulation of the cutting process stabilizes, i.e., it becomes independent of the preliminary phase that starts from the unloaded state (this will be used in calculating the draft force from the plots as discussed in Fig. 7).  From the numerical point of view, the simulation with such stress histories demands larger number of equilibrium iterations (we used the standard updated Newton\u2013Raphson method) and a very careful monitoring of the convergence at each load step.  As already mentioned the analysis is quasi-static, the stress\u2013strain states in the whole FE model are calculated for increasing horizontal distance traveled by the blade (denoted by u in Fig. 5). The forces (draft and lift) acting on the blade are determined by properly integrating the stress components. The increments of u are assumed in steps (representing as the \u2018load\u2019 steps in ANSYS), which are larger between the separation instances and smaller around the separation. The size of each subsequent step can be estimated from the   \u03b5   x   readings of the previous step. The values of such steps are quite important from the numerical viewpoint since too small steps may result in a substantial increase of the time of calculations.  For an assumed mesh size a typical calculated draft force depends on the distance traveled as shown in Fig. 7. The calculations start as elastic (OE range) with all the bonding forces active (and therefore all the soil elements still connected), enter the plastic deformation at some point E, and then go to inelastic phase until deformation in the vicinity of the tip of the blade (point A) measured as   \u03b5   x   , reaches the value of   \u03b5   c   . This happens when the blade\u05f3s displacement and the corresponding draft force reach the level defined as point   T   1   .  Then the bonding force in the first node is deactivated (or the elements above and below the separation plane closest to the blade are allowed to separate) that brings about a drop in the magnitude of the draft force to the value corresponding to point   B   1   .  The opening equal to the element size along the separation surface is created and the stresses and deformation in its vicinity are reduced enough (see the explanations in the previous section) for the analysis to start at   B   1   from an elastic level. Then first the yielding condition is reached, and next the instant when   \u03b5   x   increases again to   \u03b5   c   , which takes place at the blade\u05f3s displacement and the draft force denoted by point   T   2   . Deactivating the bonding force in the second node bring the draft force to the level indicated by point   B   2   (in the elastic range), and so on. The elements separated in the first and second deactivations are indicated with the broken lines.   Fig. 7 represents a typical relationship for the draft force versus the blade\u05f3s displacement covering five separations (i.e., the cutting/opening runs through five elements) as obtained from the simulation.  Some details of the meshing and opening after three separations are shown in Fig. 8. One can note in the enlarged picture that the elements above the separation line have shrunk about 30% in the horizontal direction, which is the consequence of assuming \u03b5  c =0.3.  The separation simulated by the FE model takes place sequentially at the nodes on the separation surfaces, as already discussed. When the bonding force at a particular node is deactivated the system suddenly changes its overall stiffness resulting in the draft force drop indicated by a jump   T   i   \u2212   B   i   . It should be noted that in the \u2018discrete\u2019 modeling the separation force F (   T   i   ) is calculated for an underestimated length of the opening in front of the blade (i.e., shorter than for continues separation), and for an overestimated bonding force in the node to separate. Similarly, force F (   B   i   ) is calculated for an overestimated length of the opening and for an underestimated bonding force at the same node. Therefore one may interpret F (   T   i   ) as an upper limit of the draft force calculated continuously, while F (   B   i   ) as a lower limit of that force.  How much the draft force is over- and underestimated (or the difference F (   T   i   ) \u2212 F (   B   i   ) ) depends on the element size e on the separation plane (see Fig. 8). However, as our numerical experimentations will indicate (to be presented in the next section), the average force  F \u00af  = [ ( F (   T   i   ) + F (   B   i   ) ] / 2 for e small enough appears to be essentially independent of meshing. Therefore it can be considered as an approximation of the draft force for the blade\u05f3s displacement u at the instant of a particular separation. This force is plotted as a broken line,  F \u00af  in Fig. 7; note that it becomes almost constant even after one or two separation. Such a force is denoted by   F   D   , and it should represent the draft force to characterize the soil\u2013tool interaction for particular conditions assumed in the simulation.  Since the shape of nonlinear portions E \u2212   T   1   and   B   i   \u2212   T   i + 1   of the draft force\u2013displacement characteristic are of less importance, the plots in the next sections will be simplified to show only points   T   i   and   B   i   (to demonstrate how they are getting closer with smaller e), and then  F \u00af  and the value of   F   D   .   RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS   In this section the FE model and procedure proposed are tested for convergence. The main focus is on accuracy of calculating the draft force. The results are validated by comparing them with the formulas that for straight blades are available in the literature.  As discussed in Section 2.2.4 the choice of the size of elements on the separation surface in the vicinity of the blade\u05f3s tip, denoted by e in Fig. 8, affects the plot representing the calculated draft force and the displacement of the blade. Typical results for different e and for d 1=50mm, w 1=50mm, and \u03b1 =   90  \u2218  (vertical blade) are shown in Fig. 9. Clearly, smaller e reduces the difference F (   T   i   ) \u2212 F (   B   i   ) , but also makes the mesh more dense that in turn increases the computation time.  For example, if e=8.7mm (low density meshing, 1876 elements) then the calculation time to obtain the F\u2013u plot for u up to 16mm is about 15h (for a computer with Intel core i5 3.2GH processor and 4GB of RAM). If the element size is reduced to e=7.8mm (for regular density meshing, 2472 elements) then the time increases to 19h, and to 22h if e=6.7 mm (for high density meshing, 2854 elements).  The effect of e on the average force  F \u00af  = [ ( F (   T   i   ) + F (   B   i   ) ] / 2 is shown in Fig. 10. As can be seen, the results for the regular and high meshing patterns are practically indistinguishable; therefore for computational efficiency the regular mesh density was selected for this case. For the low density meshing the force   F   D   = 915  N (see the definition in Fig. 7), then it drops by 2% to   F   D   = 896  N if the regular density meshing, and drops 0.3% further to   F   D   = 893  N for the high density meshing.  Similar results for d 1=50mm, w 1= 50mm, and rake angle \u03b1 =   60  \u2218  are presented in Fig. 11, where e=8.4, 7.0, 5.8 were used.  The corresponding averaged draft force  F \u00af  is shown in Fig. 12. For e=8.4mm (low density meshing, 2186 elements) the draft force   F   D   = 485  N . This force drops by 7.8% to   F   D   = 446  N if the mesh size is reduced to e=7mm (regular density meshing, 3548 elements), and further by 1.3% to   F   D   = 441  N if e=5.8mm (high density meshing, 4982 elements). As can be seen, the results for the regular and high meshing patterns are practically indistinguishable; therefore for computational efficiency the regular mesh density could be selected to analyze this case.  For straight blades the following formula [8] is used for the draft force:  (6)    F   D   \u2032   = (   \u03b3   s     d   1   2     N   \u03b3   + c   d   1     N   c   + Q   d   1     N   q   )   w   1     where \u03b3  s is soil specific weight, c is soil cohesion, Q is bearing pressure (due to soil accumulation), d 1 is cutting depth of the blade, w 1 is the width of blade (width of cut soil) and (   N   \u03b3   ,    N   c   ,    N   q   ) are tabulated cutting factors that depend on the soil friction angle \u03d5, and the blade rake angle \u03b1. In our case, the last term is negligible, i.e., Q   d   1     N   q   \u2248 0 , while the factors   N   \u03b3   ,    N   c   for the cases presented in Figs. 9 and 10 and in 11 and 12 are N  \u03b3 =10.3, N  c =22.0 for the blade with \u03b1 =   90  \u2218  , and N  \u03b3 =4.94, N  c =9.26 for the blade with \u03b1 =   60  \u2218  . Substituting into (6) one obtains   F   D   \u2032   =892N for the case presented in Figs. 9 and 10 (0.4% difference with   F   D   =896N of FEA results), and   F   D   \u2032   =470 N for the case in Figs. 11 and 12 (5.1% difference with   F   D   =446N of FEA results). Using the proposed methodology the cases covering the range of   d   1   = 25 \u2013 50  mm ,   w   1   = 20 \u2212 160  mm , and \u03b1=30\u201390\u00b0 were simulated. In general, the differences between the simulated values   F   D   and the values   F   D   \u2032   calculated from (6) were typically about 2\u20133%, but never higher than 5%, which validates the methodology.  The simulations rendered the deformation patterns that generally agreed with the expectations and what was described in [28,29]. For the case in Figs. 9 and 10 the displacement in the z-direction when the blade is moved by about u=16mm is presented in Fig. 13. The disturbed soil is accumulated in front of the blade and tends to swell up in upward and lateral directions with respect to its original configuration. Also, the profile of accumulated soil form a convex curve as indicated in [29]. It can be seen more clearly in Fig. 14.  The plastic strains in the X\u2013Y plane of the blade\u05f3s front for u=16mm are plotted in Fig. 14. One can observe that these strains concentrate in a relatively narrow band inclined about \u03b8 \u2248   29  \u2218  from the horizontal line. According to the simplified limit analysis this inclination should be \u03b8 = 45 \u2212 35 / 2 =   27.5  \u2218  which is close to the value obtained from the simulation in FEA.  Similar deformation patterns were obtained for the case from Figs. 11 and 12. Fig. 15 shows the deformed shape after the blade has been moved by about u=8mm with the soil accumulation and the upper surface profile analogous to the previous case. A more detailed horizontal displacement distribution in the X\u2013Y plane is plotted in Fig. 16.   CONCLUSION   A new procedure for simulating the soil\u2013blade interaction by the Finite Element Method is presented. The procedure combines the non-associated Drucker\u2013Prager constitutive law with a compaction strain based separation criterion to describe the behavior of soil while being cut by the blade. Several separation and sliding surfaces are defined and utilized in the analysis. The elements on these surfaces are bonded to each other by special use of contact elements. During motion of the blade through soil, the bonding along the separation surfaces is allowed to break resulting in separation of the soil elements in front of the blade. The sliding surfaces allow the soil to slide upward and sideways of the blade. A method of calculating the draft force that essentially eliminates the effects of \u2018discrete\u2019 disjoining particular nodes is proposed and tested for convergence.  The whole procedure is applied here to simulate the straight blades only, mainly for the purpose of validation. The simulation results appear to show a good correlation when compared with the semi-analytical formulas of the classical soil mechanics.  It is planned to extend the procedure\u05f3s applications to the analysis of blades of arbitrary shapes, which in turn can be used in developing software for optimization of the tillage operations.   REFERENCES", "highlights": "In this manuscript a finite element (FE) investigation of soil\u2013blade interaction is presented. The soil is considered as an elastic\u2013plastic material with the non-associated Drucker\u2013Prager constitutive law. A separation procedure to model the cutting of soil and a method of calculating the forces acting on the blade are proposed and discussed in detail. The procedure uses a separation criterion that becomes active at consecutive nodes on the predefined separation surfaces. In order to mimic soil\u2013blade sliding and soil\u2013soil cutting phenomena contact elements with different properties are applied. Only rectangular shape blades are used in the simulation in order to verify the methodology by comparing the FE results with available analytical predictions, and examine the model\u05f3s convergence. It is believed that the approach presented can be used to investigate the soil\u2013tool interactions of real and more complex blade geometries and soil conditions and ultimately for improving design of blades used in tillage operations."}
