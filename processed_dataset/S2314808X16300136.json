Flip-flop operation: Reset pulse's wavelength is shorter than Set pulse's wavelength.      Numerical model is solved by parallel computing using GPGPU card.      Single Set-Reset and multiple Set-Reset operations are simulated in time domain.          KEYPHRASES   All-optical flip-flop  DFB laser  Optical nonlinearity  Urbach tail   All optical Internet requires all optical devices to process optical data directly (without conversion to electrical signal) in the optical domain. Particularly, all-optical flip-flops have roles as all optical memory elements, and these memory elements could be used in all optical data routing [1]. The all-optical flip-flop could be used for other applications such as optical shift register, optical random access memory and other applications [2]. Several schemes/devices are suggested for all-optical flip-flop devices. In [3], a device that is based on two coupled laser diode is presented. A device that is constructed from ring laser is presented in [4]. A device with two states of a clockwise and an anti-clockwise laser mode is introduced in [5]. Devices that are based on a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser, and on vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifier (VCSOA) are shown in [6] and [7] respectively. All these devices require a holding beam or show output power in both states of the flip flop. Devices that have bistable optical output and do not require a holding beam are discussed in [8,9]. These devices have a saturable absorber in the laser cavity which has large optical loss at low light intensity in the laser cavity, and optical loss is reduced at high optical power intensity in the cavity.  In [10], a chirped DFB laser structure that behaves as an all-optical flip-flop is simulated. The flip-flop has a bi-stable output optical power behavior. The operation of the device does not require a holding beam. The chirped grating is accompanied by a linearly increasing negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail (The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs density that reduce the refractive index close to the band-gap energy). In the \u201cOFF\u201d state the chirp prevents constructive feedback from the grating and lasing does not occur. At high light intensity,the chirp is reduced due to negative nonlinearity, and the laser mode builds up. The device is switched \u201cOFF\u201d by cross gain modulation. An optical pulse of a wavelength longer than the operating wavelength reduces the gain of the active layer, and in the same time does not produce much change in the refractive index (lower absorption coefficient at a longer wavelength).  In this work, a new design for an all-optical flip-flop is simulated. Instead of the chirped grating accompanied with a linear increasing negative nonlinear coefficient, a part of the wave-guiding grating of the suggested device is detuned from the rest of the grating. The detuned part has a slightly higher refractive index than the rest of the grating and has a negative nonlinear coefficient. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to partial absorption of photons at the Urbach tail. The structure investigated in this work is easier to fabricate than the structure mentioned in [10] because only one nonlinear section is needed to achieve optical bistability in the laser device. The switch OFF (\u201cReset\u201d) mechanism is done by cross gain modulation (XGM), and a \u201cReset\u201d pulse at a wavelength shorter than the wavelength of the \u201cSet\u201d pulse is used. The \u201cReset\u201d pulse has a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) than the \u201cSet\u201d pulse and the operating frequency, which produces more design flexibility. This is in contrast to the device in [10], where the the \u201cReset\u201d pulse has to be at a lower frequency than the operating frequency. In the next section the device schematic is presented and the flip-flop design is discussed.  The suggested device consists of a nonlinear DFB laser structure. The refractive index distribution along the wave-guiding layer of the device is shown in Fig.\u00a01 . The grating period is adjusted as  2  n \u00af  d =  \u03bb G   , where  n \u00af  is the average refractive index along the grating, d is the grating period, \u03bbG is the wavelength at the center of the reflection band of the grating. The device has a phase shift section in the middle of the grating. The optical gain is provided by electrical current injected into the active layer along the wave-guiding layer. The negative nonlinear coefficient is due to direct absorption of photons at the Urbach tail at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap energy in the nonlinear section. The loss coefficient at the Urbach tail is expressed as:  \u03b1  ( \u03c9 )  =  \u03b1 0  \u00d7 e x p  (     (  \u210f \u03c9 \u2212 \u210f  \u03c9 g   )   /   E 0     )    [11,12],  \u210f  \u03c9 g  =  E g   is the band gap energy, \u210f is the Plank's constant (The energies are expressed in electron volt). The absorbed photons produce electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index at a photon energy slightly less than the semiconductor band-gap. At low optical power intensity in the structure, the detuned part of the wave-guiding layer reduces the available optical feedback to the laser mode, and the laser mode does not build up. To set the flip-flop \u201cON\u201d, an optical pulse of wavelength \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 1 is injected, at z\u2009=\u20090, where \u03bb 1\u2009=\u2009\u03bbG . The semiconductor band gap energy Eg in the nonlinear section is adjusted such that the photons energies at \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 1 is slightly less than Eg . Fig.\u00a02 shows the gain spectrum of the device [13], the \u201cSet\u201d and \u201cReset\u201d pulses frequencies (wavelengths), and the optical loss at Urbach tail. The injected \u201cSet\u201d pulse induces electron-hole pair densities in the nonlinear section and reduces its refractive index and its detuning; hence it provides extra optical feedback to photons of wavelength around \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 1, the optical mode builds up and provides optical power (photons) that produce electron-hole pairs in the nonlinear section and maintain the reduction in the detuning in that section.  To reset the flip-flop, an optical pulse at \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 2 is injected at z\u2009=\u20090. In this work we choose \u03bb 2\u2009<\u2009\u03bb 1, which means that the reset pulse will be absorbed in the nonlinear section and may prevent the flip-flop from switching \u201cOFF\u201d properly. At   L / 2  < z <   3 L  / 4   along the wave-guiding layer, the band-gap of the wave-guiding layer is altered to provide large absorption to photons of wavelength \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 2 (Fig.\u00a03 ). In Section \u201c1\u201d, the band gap energy is higher than \u201cSet/Reset\u201d pulse photons energies. In section \u201c2\u201d, the \u201cReset\u201d pulse will be absorbed because the band gap energy is lower than the \u201cReset\u201d pulse photon energy. The \u201cReset\u201d pulse energy is totally absorbed in section \u201c2\u201d before it reaches section \u201c3\u201d. Section \u201c3\u201d is the detuned grating section, its band gap energy is slightly higher than the \u201cSet\u201d pulse photon energy and the output laser mode photon energy. The absorption loss   \u03b1  S e t    at the \u201cSet\u201d pulse frequency (\u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1 or \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb1), and the absorption loss   \u03b1  Reset    at the \u201cReset\u201d pulse frequency (\u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2 or \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb2) are plotted in Fig.\u00a04 .  In this work it was assumed \u03bb 1\u2009=\u20091500\u2009nm and \u03bb 2\u2009=\u20091450\u2009nm (Window of low absorption loss in optical fiber). The reset pulse reduces the optical gain of the laser mode by XGM, and it is absorbed in section \u201c2\u201d. Whence the optical laser mode gain is reduced the light intensity at \u03bb\u2009=\u2009\u03bb 1 is reduced and electron-hole density in section \u201c3\u201d decays toward zero, the optical feedback in the cavity is reduced and the device is switched OFF. In the next sections, a mathematical model of the device is presented an solved numerically. \u201cSet/Reset\u201d dynamics are simulated in time domain and results are discussed.  To simulate the switching dynamics in the structure coupled mode equations are used to model optical fields inside the structure [14]. The optical modes are coupled with rate equations. The total optical field is expressed as:  E  (  z ,  t  )  =  E +    (  z ,  t  )  exp  [  i \u03b2 z \u2212 i \u03c9 t  ]  +  E \u2212    (  z ,  t  )  exp  [  \u2212 i \u03b2 z \u2212 i \u03c9 t  ]  + c . c .  . The optical laser mode is modeled at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1.  \u03b2 =   2 \u03c0  n \u00af   /   \u03bb G     .  The \u201cReset\u201d pulse angular frequency \u03c9 2 is far detuned from reflection band of the grating. The \u201cReset\u201d pulse optical field in the structure has only a propagating component in the +ve z direction and is expressed as   E  Reset   = E    (  z ,  t  )   R  \u00d7 exp  [  i \u03b2 z \u2212 i \u03c9 t  ]  + c . c .  , and \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2. It is assumed that the reset pulse is amplified in the first section (0\u2009<\u2009z\u2009<\u2009L/2), and it is attenuated in the second section (   L / 2  < z <   3 L  / 4   ). Due to large attenuation constant in the second section (compared to optical gain provided by the active layer), only loss coefficient is applied to the \u201cReset\u201d pulse in the second section. In section \u201c2\u201d, it is assumed the propagating reset pulse optical power is multiplied by  exp  [  \u2212  \u222b   L / 2   z   \u03b1  (   \u03c9 2   )  d z  ]   . It is assumed that the \u201cReset\u201d pulse is completely consumed in the second section, and no \u201cReset\u201d signal propagates in the third section. The equations that model the all-optical flip-flop are as follows:  (1)        \u2202  E +    \u2202 z   +   n \u00af  c    \u2202  E +    \u2202 t   =   (  i  \u0393 1  +  g 2   (  1 + i \u03b3  )  \u2212    \u03b1  c a v    2   )   E +         +   (  i  \u0393 2  exp  [  i \u03d5  ( z )  + i 2 \u03b4 \u03b2 z  ]   )   E \u2212          (2)        \u2202  E \u2212    \u2202 z   \u2212   n \u00af  c    \u2202  E \u2212    \u2202 t   =  \u2212  (  i  \u0393 1  +  g 2   (  1 + i \u03b3  )  \u2212    \u03b1  c a v    2   )   E \u2212         \u2212   (  i  \u0393 2  exp  [  \u2212 i \u03d5  ( z )  \u2212 i 2 \u03b4 \u03b2 z  )   ]   E +          (3)         \u2202  E R    \u2202 z   +   n \u00af  c    \u2202  E R    \u2202 t   =  (  i  \u0393 1  +  g 2   (  1 + i \u03b3  )  \u2212    \u03b1  c a v    2   )   E R            (4)    \u0393 1  =   2 \u03c0    \u03bb G     (  \u03b4 n  ( z )  \u2212  |    d n   d N    |   N c    (  1 \u2212 i \u03be  )   )  + i   \u03b1  (  z ,   \u03c9  1 , 2    )   2        (5)    \u0393 2  =  4   \u03bb G    \u0394 n       (6)     \u2202  N c    (  z ,  t  )    \u2202 t   = \u2212    N c     \u03c4 c    \u2212 B  N c 2  \u2212 C  N c 3  +   \u03b1  (  z ,   \u03c9 1   )   I 1    \u210f  \u03c9 1    +   \u03b1  (  z ,   \u03c9 2   )   I 2    \u210f  \u03c9 2          (7)     \u2202  N g    (  z ,  t  )    \u2202 t   =    I  current     q V   \u2212    N g     \u03c4 g    \u2212 B  N g 2  \u2212 C  N g 3  \u2212  v g  \u0398  (  g  (   \u03c9 1   )   S 1  + g  (   \u03c9 2   )   S 2   )        (8)   g  (   \u03c9  1 , 2    )  =   g  (    \u03c9 \u02dc   1 , 2    )   (   N g  \u2212  N  t r    )    1 + \u03f5  (   S 1  +  S 2   )          Equations 1 and 2 present the two counter propagating modes in the device. Equation 3 describes the \u201cReset\u201d pulse propagation in the structure. \u03931 presents the detuning along the structure due to optical gain change and refractive index change, and it presents the optical loss in the cavity. \u03932 is the coupling between forward mode and backward mode. In the simulations  c = 3 \u00d7   10  8   m/s  .   n \u00af  = 3  is the average refractive index along the structure. \u0394n\u2009=\u20090.001, and \u03b4n\u2009=\u20090.006, for 3L/4\u2009<\u2009z\u2009<\u2009L and 0 otherwise. The optical nonlinearity in the nonlinear section (Section \u201c3\u201d) is due to direct absorption of photons at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1. A part of photons is absorbed and electron-hole pairs are generated. The electron-hole pairs generated reduce the refractive index at photon energies just below the energy gap of the semiconductor. At photon energy below the band gap energy the loss follows Urbach tail expression [12],  \u03b1  ( \u03c9 )  =  \u03b1 0  \u00d7 e x p  (     (  \u210f \u03c9 \u2212 \u210f  \u03c9 g   )   /   E 0     )   ,  \u210f  \u03c9 g  =  E g   , E 0 is around 0.01\u2009eV. In this simulation  \u03b1  (   \u03c9 1   )  = 480  c  m  \u2212 1    for 3L/4\u2009<\u2009z\u2009<\u2009L and 0 otherwise.  \u03b1  (   \u03c9 2   )  = 9600    cm   \u2212 1    , for   L / 2  < z <   3 L  / 4   and 0 otherwise. The change in the refractive index due to the change in the electron-hole density is  \u2212  |    d n  /  d N    |  \u00d7  N c   , and \u2212|dn/dN|\u2009=\u2009\u221210\u221226\u2009m3 [15,16]. \u03be\u2009=\u20090.03 is the ratio between the change in the refractive index to the change in the optical loss due to the generated electron hole density [16]. I 1 and I 2 are the optical power density on the \u201cSet\u201d pulse (optical laser mode at \u03c9 1) and the \u201cReset\u201d pulse (at \u03c9 2) respectively. S 1 and S 2 are the photons densities in the laser cavity at \u03c9 1 and \u03c9 2 respectively. \u03d5\u2009=\u20090 for 0\u2009<\u2009z\u2009<\u2009/L/2, and \u03d5\u2009=\u2009\u03c0 otherwise. It was assumed  g  (    \u03c9 \u02dc  2   )  = 0.5 \u00d7 g  (    \u03c9 \u02dc  1   )   . Other simulation parameters are shown in Table\u00a01 .  The structure is divided into 80 sections. In each section, the forward and backward fields are calculated using Rung-Kutta methods. The electron hole densities in the wave-guiding layer and the active layer are calculated with the same methods. In each step, random fields are added to the backward and forward mode to model the spontaneous emissions. To reduce the simulation time, the simulations are performed on a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU). In each time step, the calculation load is distributed among 80 parallel threads; a thread per each section along the length of the structure (one can assign more threads per section). The integration step along the z axis is L/80, and the time step is     n \u00af  L  /  c 80    . The work is performed on a PC machine 32\u2009GB, processor: Intel Core i3-4130 CPU @ 3.40\u2009GHz\u2009\u00d7\u20094, GPGPU: Geforce GTX 670. The simulation code is written using CUDA C [17]. The simulation's time on PC is reduced 20 times by using GPGPU computing. In the following sections results and numerical simulations of the device are shown.  In the following simulation the output optical field is normalized to   P 0  = 0.05 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    watt  . Ng is normalized to   N  t h    . Nc is normalized to   N 0  =   10   23     m  \u2212 3    .  To determine the required injected current to obtain two stable optical level output (at the same injected current) a numerical experiment is performed. The injected current is increased linearly from zero to 0.122 Ampere in 75\u2009ns, then the injected current is reduced again to 0 linearly in 75\u2009ns. At part of the current versus optical output relation is plotted in Fig.\u00a05 . In the following simulations, the injected current I\u2009=\u200995.523\u2009mA is assumed. It insures bistable operation of the device.  The output optical power in the \u201cOFF\u201d state at z\u2009=\u2009L is simulated in time domain for 75\u2009ns, Fig.\u00a06 (a). The \u201cON\u201d state is triggered by an input pulse injected at z\u2009=\u20090, of power P\u2009=\u2009P 0 and time width t\u2009=\u2009187.5 picosecond (  9.375 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    picojule  ). The device is triggered at t\u2009=\u20097.5\u2009ns from the start of the simulation time, the output optical power at z\u2009=\u2009L is shown in Fig.\u00a06(b). The injected pulse at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1 is amplified along the structure and a part of photons is absorbed at the Urbach tail in the third section (the nonlinear section). The absorbed photons generate electron-hole pairs that reduce the refractive index of that section. As the detuning of this section decreases, the grating in this section starts to reflect back more photons back to the device and decreases the number of photons leaving the device at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1. The optical feedback along the structure increases and the laser mode at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1 builds up. As the optical power of the laser mode builds up, it maintains the number of photons in section 3 that are required to generate the electron hole density needed to set the detuning of this section to a low value.  The electron hole density Nc normalized to N 0 in the nonlinear section (Section 3) at (z\u2009=\u20097L/8), is shown in Fig.\u00a07 . The electron hole density in the active layer Ng normalized to   N  t h    is plotted in Fig.\u00a08 at z\u2009=\u20097L/8.        (  \u03b4 n \u2212  |    d n  /  d N    |  \u00d7  N c   )   /  \u0394 n    is plotted in Fig.\u00a09 . It shows the relative changes in the refractive index in the nonlinear section after 75\u2009ns in the \u201cOFF\u201d and in the \u201cON\u201d states at z\u2009=\u20097L/8.  \u201cON/OFF\u201d transitions are simulated in time domain. A \u201cSet\u201d pulse followed by a \u201cReset\u201d pulse are injected to the structure at z\u2009=\u20090, and the optical fields are simulated for 5.625\u2009ns. A \u201cSet\u201d pulse of power P\u2009=\u2009P 0 and width 0.1875\u2009ns (  9.375 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    picojule  ), at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1 and t\u2009=\u20090.5625\u2009ns switches the flip-flop \u201cON\u201d. Another pulse at t\u2009=\u20092.8125\u2009ns, of power P\u2009=\u2009P 0, pulse width 0.9375\u2009ns (\u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2,  46.875 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    picojule  ) switches the Flip-Flop \u201cOFF\u201d. The output field at z\u2009=\u2009L is shown in Fig.\u00a010 . The evolution of Nc /N 0, and     N g   /   N  t r      with time at z\u2009=\u20097L/8 are shown in Figs.\u00a011 and 12 respectively.   The \u201cReset\u201d pulse at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2 is amplified in the first half of the device. In section \u201c2\u201d, the pulse is absorbed almost completely due to large attenuation coefficient. The amplification of pulse in that section is neglected compared to the large attenuation by the semiconductor of band gap   E g  < \u210f  \u03c9 2   . The \u201cReset\u201d pulse reduces the gain of the optical laser mode at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1 by XGM. When the optical gain of the laser mode is reduced, the photons absorbed in section \u201c3\u201d are reduced, and also the electron hole pairs generated in the wave-guiding layer in that section are reduced, the refractive index increases and the detuning is restored to its value in the \u201cOFF\u201d state. The \u201cReset\u201d pulse at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2 is totally absorbed in section \u201c2\u201d, it does not reach section \u201c3\u201d, and does not affect the electron hole densities in section \u201c3\u201d. As the \u201cReset\u201d pulse is absorbed in section \u201c2\u201d, it generates electron hole pairs that changed the detuning for the laser mode along that section. The refractive index distributions during \u201cSet/Reset\u201d operation in both sections \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d at successive time frames are shown in Fig.\u00a013 .  Multiple \u201cSet/Reset\u201d operations are simulated in the time domain for 45\u2009ns. The input pulses at z\u2009=\u20090 are shown in Fig.\u00a014 . Each \u201cSet\u201d pulses is followed by a \u201cReset\u201d pulse after 9\u2009ns. \u201cReset\u201d pulse is followed by a \u201cSet\u201d pulse after 6\u2009ns. The input \u201cSet\u201d pulse of P\u2009=\u2009P 0 has pulse width 0.1875\u2009ns (  9.375 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    picojoule  at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 1). The \u201cReset\u201d pulse of P\u2009=\u2009P 0 has pulse width 0.9375\u2009ns (  46.875 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3    picojoule  at \u03c9\u2009=\u2009\u03c9 2) switches the Flip-Flop \u201cOFF\u201d. The output optical power at z\u2009=\u2009L is shown in Fig.\u00a015 . The time evolution of Nc /N 0 z\u2009=\u20097L/8 during multiple \u201cSet/Reset\u201d operations is shown in Fig.\u00a016 .     N g   /   N  t r      time evolution is plotted in Fig.\u00a017 .   DISCUSSION   The device operation requires altering the band gap of the semiconductor material in the wave-guiding layer. This could be done as the device is fabricated from InGaAsP alloy on InP substrate. By changing the percentage of the InGaAsP alloy ingredient, the band gap could be changed [18]. The extinction ratio is  L o  g  10     (     P  O N    /   P  O F F      )  \u2243 \u2212 15  , and no holding beam is required for bi-stable operation. During \u201cSet\u201d operation the output optical field takes 0.5\u2009ns to stabilize; however Nc takes about 10\u2009ns to reach its steady state value (     N c   /   N 0    = 3.5  ) (Fig.\u00a07); however, an input pulse with higher energy can lead Nc to reach steady state in a shorter time. During \u201cSet/Reset\u201d operation (Fig.\u00a010), a \u201cReset\u201d pulse of width 0.9375\u2009ns is injected to the device; however, the output optical output power takes about 2\u2009ns to reach the optical level of the \u201cOFF\u201d state. The \u201cReset\u201d dynamics in time domain are shown during Nc transition state (before Nc reaches transition state) in case of single \u201cON/OFF\u201d (or \u201cSet/Reset\u201d) operation (Figs.\u00a010\u201312) and at the end of Nc transition state (9\u2009ns after \u201cSet\u201d pulse) during multiple \u201cSet/Reset\u201d operation (Figs.\u00a015\u201317).   CONCLUSION   In this work, an all-optical flip-flop based on a non-linear semiconductor DFB laser structure is introduced. The \u201cReset\u201d mechanism uses an optical pulse of a shorter wavelength than the \u201cSet\u201d pulse wavelength. The device could be built using InGaAsP alloy. Simulations show that a \u201cSet\u201d pulse of 0.1875\u2009ns pulse width switched the device \u201cON\u201d and optical mode stabilizes in 0.5\u2009ns. A \u201cReset\u201d pulse of 0.9375\u2009ns pulse width switches the device \u201cOFF\u201d in 2\u2009ns. The switching dynamics are in nanoseconds time scale and it is suitable for all optical data packets routing.   REFERENCES", "highlights": "An all-optical flip-flop based on a nonlinear multi-section DFB semiconductor laser structure is proposed. Holding beam is not required for device's operation. A section of the DFB structure is detuned to prevent lasing in the \u201cOFF\u201d state, and it is accompanied with a negative nonlinear coefficient that is due to partial absorption of photons at Urbach tail. At a high light intensity in the structure the nonlinear coefficient reduces the detuning, and the device is in lasing state; \u201cON\u201d state. The device is reset by an optical pulse at a shorter wavelength through cross gain modulation. The reset pulse is absorbed in a middle section in the device before reaching the detuned nonlinear section. The switching times between the states are in nanoseconds time scale."}
