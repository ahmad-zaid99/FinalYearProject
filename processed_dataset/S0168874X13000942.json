As a result, the energy associated with these atoms will be different from that of the atoms in the bulk. The excess energy associated with surface atoms is called surface free energy. In classical continuum mechanics, such surface free energy is typically neglected because it is associated with only a few layers of atoms near the surface and the ratio of the volume occupied by the surface atoms and the total volume of material of interest is extremely small. However, for micro/nano-size particles, wires and films, the surface to volume ratio becomes significant, and so does the effect of surface free energy.  Ultra-thin plate structures with submicron thicknesses have attracted much attention due to their potential as sensitive, high frequency devices for applications in Micro-electromechanical Systems (MEMS) and Nano-electromechanical Systems (NEMS) [1\u20133]. For structures with submicron sizes, due to the increasing surface-to-bulk ratio, surface effects are likely to be significant and can considerably modify macroscopic properties [4,5].  It is known that there exists a size-dependent mechanical response of ultra-thin elastic films with nano-scale thickness [6\u20139]. The understanding and modeling of such size-dependence due to surface effects is currently of particular interest [10\u201312]. Atomistic simulations results have shown that elastic constants of ultra-thin films can be larger or smaller than their bulk counterparts due to the effect of surface energy [13,14]. Furthermore, the elastic constants of the surface may have positive or negative values. In addition, the atomistic lattice model further demonstrates that the values of elastic constants of ultra-thin films are thickness dependent and approach the bulk value as the film thickness increases [15\u201317]. However, systematic atomistic studies of mechanical response of thin films need tremendous computational efforts; therefore, they are of limited usage in practical applications.  Gurtin and Murdoch [18\u201321] formulated a generic continuum model of surface elasticity, where the surface of solids can be viewed as a two dimensional elastic membrane with different material constants adhering to the underlying bulk material without slipping. It is found that the continuum by incorporating surface elasticity can predict the same accurate elastic response of thin films similarly as given by the atomistic modeling, if the proper surface constitutive constants are used [8]. Recently, He et al. [10] proposed a rigorous continuum surface elasticity model and successfully analyzed the size-dependent deformation of nano-films. The surface effects on the deflection behavior of ultra-thin films are investigated by incorporating surface elasticity into the Von Karman plate theory without consideration of the non-zero normal stress along the thickness direction [22]. However, the continuum model proposed by Lu et al. [23] takes into account the effect of non-zero normal stress but neglects the effect of nonlinearity. Huang [24] investigated a modified continuum model of elastic films with nano-scale thickness by incorporating surface elasticity into the conventional nonlinear Von Karman Plate theory. A set of governing equations is derived taken into account surface effects, effect of non-zero normal stress and large deflection.  Steigmann and Ogden [25,26] generalized the Gurtin\u2013Murdoch theory to incorporate flexural stiffness of the free surface directly into the constitutive response of surface. Dingreville and Qu [27] investigated the influence of Poisson's ratio effect on the surface properties under general loading conditions. Moreover, the effect of pre-surface tension on the elastic properties of nano structures is studied by Wang et al. [28,29]. In the absence of external loading, the surface pre-tension will induce a residual stress field in the bulk of nano structures. Based on the elastic behavior of nano-sized structural elements such as nano-particles, nano-wires and nano-films, Dingreville [30] investigated an approach for the size dependency of the overall elastic behavior of such nano-sized structural elements.  Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are microscopically inhomogeneous composite materials, in which the volume fraction of the two or more materials is varied smoothly and continuously as a continuous function of the material position along one or more dimension of the structure. The concept of functionally graded material (FGM) was proposed in 1984 by the material scientists in Japan [31]. Alieldin et al. [32] suggested three approaches to transform the laminated composite plate, with stepped material properties, to an equivalent functionally graded (FG) plate with a continuous property function across the plate thickness. Such transformations are used to determine the details of a functionally graded plate equivalent to the original laminated one.  The FGM is suitable for various applications, such as thermal coatings of barrier for ceramic engines, gas turbines, nuclear fusions, optical thin layers, biomaterial electronics, etc. Alibeigloo [33] derived an exact solution for thermo-elastic response of functionally graded rectangular plates subjected to thermo-mechanical loads. A finite element analysis of thermoelastic field in a rotating FGM circular disk is studied by Afsar and Go [34]. This study focuses on the finite element analysis of thermoelastic field in a thin circular functionally graded material disk subjected to a thermal load and an inertia force due to rotation of the disk. Tung, et al. [35] derived a simple analytical approach to investigate the nonlinear stability of functionally graded plates under mechanical and thermal loads. Equilibrium and compatibility equations for FG plates are derived by using the classical plate theory. Alshorbagy et al. [36] studied the stability of FGMs in high thermal environments. To this aim, a finite element model is presented to study the thermo-elastic behavior of FG plates.  In general, there are many approaches to homogenization of FGM. The choice of the approach should be based on the gradient of gradation relative to the size of a typical representative volume element. Aboudi et al. [37,38] presented studies accounting for local material grading include the constitutive modeling theory based on the higher-order generalized method of cells applied to FGM [37] that was further extended to account for incremental plasticity, creep, and viscoplastic effects in Aboudi et al. [38]. Moreover, a micromechanical analysis of an elastic FGM accounting for the local interaction between the particles and the local gradation effect has recently been conducted by Yin et al. [39]. The subject of the effective thermal conductivity of FGM was also addressed in Yin et al. [40]. The solution includes determining a pairwise thermal interaction followed with a derivation of the averaged heat flux fields of the phases in the particle\u2013matrix zone. The effective thermal conductivity is derived from the relationship between the gradient of temperature and the heat flux distribution.  Mindlin plate theory for continuum incorporating surface energy effects is exploited by Shaat et al. [41] to study the static behavior of ultra-thin FG plates. The transverse shear strain effect is studied by a comparison between the FG plate behavior based on Kirchhoff and Mindlin assumptions. In such analysis the material surface properties are expected to be the same for the upper and lower surfaces of the FG plate. However, the effect of neutral plane position is disregarded for the analysis of the FG plate. A generalized refined theory including surface effects is developed by L\u00fc et al. [42,43] for FG ultra-thin films with different surface properties. The classical generalized shear deformable theory is adopted to incorporate surface energy effects. In such study L\u00fc et al. neglected the effect of neutral plane position on the FG plate behavior.  In this paper, a finite element model is developed to study the behavior of ultra-thin simply supported FG Mindlin plates. Here unlike most of the literatures, [41\u201343], the effect of the neutral plane position for ultra-thin FG films is investigated. In addition to the effect of the surface energy, the effect of the plate aspect ratio is studied. A set of continuum governing differential equations which include surface energy and neutral plane position effects are derived. A simply supported micro/nano scaled films subjected to a transverse mechanical load are investigated.  In this section, Mindlin plate theory incorporating surface effects is presented. The FG plate is expected to consist of two material constituents. The neutral plane coincides with the geometric mid-plane of isotropic homogenous materials. However, neutral plane of FG plates may not coincide with its geometric mid-plane, because of the material property variation through the plate thickness. In most previous studies, [41\u201343], the neutral plane is assumed to be coincident with the mid-plane of the plate, while the position of neutral plane for FG plates must be predetermined. To predict the modifications on the classical continuum theory due to taking into account surface energy and neutral plane effects, a series of governing equations are addressed for FG ultra-thin films. Then, the presented governing equations can be solved to study the bending behavior of ultra-thin FG plates.  The Mindlin hypothesis is built up on the assumption that the transverse normals do not remain perpendicular to the mid plane after deformation. This amounts to including transverse shear strains in the theory. The inextensibility of transverse normal requires that the vertical deflection \u03c9 not be a function of the thickness coordinate z . Under the illustrated assumptions, the displacement field of the first order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) (Mindlin) is of the form  (2.1)    u   x   = u ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) + ( z +   h   0   )   \u2205   x   ( x , y )   u   y   = v ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) + ( z +   h   0   )   \u2205   y   ( x , y )   u   z   = \u03c9 ( x , y , z ) =   \u03c9   0   ( x , y )   where {   u  0  } =   {   u   0   ,    v   0   ,    \u03c9   0   ,    \u2205   x   ,    \u2205   y   }  T  are unknown functions to be determined and   h   0   denotes the position of the neutral plane (see Fig. 1) where for isotropic plates   h   0   = 0 .  When the thickness of ultra-thin plates-like films reduces to micro/nano scale, the surface has significant effects on its elastic properties, which is usually neglected in the classical thin plate theory. In the absence of external loading, initial surface tension will induce a residual stress field in the bulk of ultra-thin films. In the presence of initial surface tension, the surface of an elastic body has not a \u201cnatural state\u201d characterized by zero surface energy. Actually infinitesimal deformation of the surface is an infinitesimal incremental deformation superposed on the initial finite deformation of the surface defined by the natural state of bulk material based on the continuity of displacements from the bulk to the surface. This factious state of surface is characterized by a uniform initial surface tension. Consequently, as a function of infinitesimal surface strains/displacement gradients, the surface stresses of the plate are denoted by   \u03c4   i \u03b1   +   and   \u03c4   i \u03b1   \u2212   , respectively, and should satisfy the equilibrium relations (Gurtin and Murdoch [18,20])  (2.2)    \u03c4   i \u03b1 , \u03b1   +   \u2212    \u03c3   i z   +   = 0  ,   \u03c4   i \u03b1 , \u03b1   \u2212   +    \u03c3   i z   \u2212   = 0  i = x , y , z  ;  \u03b1 = x , y   where   \u03c3   i z   \u00b1   =    \u03c3   i z    ( z = \u00b1 h / 2 ) are the bulk stresses at z = \u00b1 h / 2 , respectively.  The resultant forces   N   i j   and resultant moments   M   i j   are defined by  (2.3)    N   i j   =  \u222b z     \u03c3   i j    d z  ,    M   i j   =  \u222b z   ( z +   h   0   )    \u03c3   i j    d z       So, the governing equations for continuum plates incorporating surface energy take the form  (2.4)    N   i \u03b2 , \u03b2   +   \u03c4   \u03b2 i , \u03b2   +   +    \u03c4   \u03b2 i , \u03b2   \u2212   \u2212   p   i   = 0 ,   M   \u03b1 \u03b2 , \u03b2   +  h 2  (   \u03c4   \u03b2 \u03b1 , \u03b2   +   \u2212    \u03c4   \u03b2 \u03b1 , \u03b2   \u2212   ) \u2212   N   \u03b1 z   \u2212   r   \u03b1   = 0      If the surface stresses are neglected, Eq. (2.4) are reduced to the classical continuum plates governing equations. The generalized resultant forces and resultant moments can be defined for continuum plate incorporating surface effects as  (2.5)    N   i \u03b1   \u204e   =   N   i \u03b1   +   \u03c4   i \u03b1   +   +    \u03c4   i \u03b1   \u2212    ;  i = x , y , z   M   \u03b1 \u03b2   \u204e   =   N   \u03b1 \u03b2   +  h 2  (   \u03c4   \u03b1 \u03b2   +   \u2212   \u03c4   \u03b1 \u03b2   \u2212   )  ;  \u03b1 , \u03b2 =  x , y   where the constitutive relations of the surface layers as given by Gurtin and Murdoch [18,20] can be expressed as follows  (2.6)    \u03c4   \u03b1 \u03b2   \u00b1   =    \u03c4   0   \u00b1     \u03b4   \u03b1 \u03b2   + (   \u03bc   0   \u00b1   \u2212   \u03c4   0   \u00b1   ) (   u   \u03b1 , \u03b2   \u00b1   +   u   \u03b2 , \u03b1   \u00b1   ) + (   \u03bb   0   \u00b1   +   \u03c4   0   \u00b1   )   u   \u03b3 , \u03b3   \u00b1     \u03b4   \u03b1 \u03b2   +    \u03c4   0   \u00b1     u   \u03b1 , \u03b2   \u00b1   ,   \u03c4   \u03b1 z   \u00b1   =    \u03c4   0   \u00b1     u   z , \u03b1   \u00b1     where   \u03c4   0   \u00b1   is the residual surface tension under unconstrained conditions,   \u03bb   0   \u00b1   and   \u03bc   0   \u00b1   are the surface Lame constants on the upper and lower surfaces, and   u   i   \u00b1   ( i = x , y , z = \u00b1 h / 2 ) denotes the displacement fields.  Since the plate is thin, the stress component   \u03c3   z z   is small comparing to the in-plane stress components, which is simply assumed to be zero in the classical plate theories. However, the surface condition (2.2) will not be satisfied with the assumption. To improve the weakness, it is assumed here that the stress component   \u03c3   z z   varies linearly through the thickness and satisfies the balance conditions on the surfaces [23]. With the assumption,   \u03c3   z z   can be written as  (2.7)    \u03c3   z z   = 0.5  (   \u03c4   \u03b2 z , \u03b2   +   \u2212   \u03c4   \u03b2 z , \u03b2   \u2212   ) +   z +   h   0    h  (   \u03c4   \u03b2 z , \u03b2   +   +   \u03c4   \u03b2 z , \u03b2   \u2212   )      The stress\u2013strain relations can then be written as  (2.8)    \u03c3   i \u03b2   =   E ( z )   1 + \u03c5    (    \u03b5   i \u03b2   +  \u03c5  1 \u2212 \u03c5     \u03b5   \u03b3 \u03b3     \u03b4   i \u03b2    )  +  \u03c5  1 \u2212 \u03c5     \u03c3   z z     \u03b4   i \u03b2     where E ( z ) is the Young's modulus, \u03c5 is the Poisson's ratio and   \u03b5   i \u03b2   = 0.5 (   u   i , \u03b2   +   u   \u03b2 , i   ) are the strain components.  The resultant forces   N   i \u03b1   \u204e   and the resultant moments   M   \u03b1 \u03b2   \u204e   for Mindlin plate theory can be obtained by substituting the displacement fields and the strain components (Eq.

Eq. (2.10) represents a series of continuum governing differential equations which include surface energy and neutral plane position effects. The obtained modifications over the classical continuum model concern two aspects, the material stiffnesses (Eq. (2.11)) and governing equations (Eq. (2.10)). If the surface stresses are neglected and the neutral plane is coincident with the mid-plane of the plate, Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11) are reduced to the classical form of governing equations and material stiffnesses.  In Eq. (2.10), the Mindlin governing equations for FG plates considering surface energy and neutral plane position effects, some terms are added to incorporate surface energy and neutral plane position effects on the plate over the classical governing equations. Hence, additional stiffnesses are added to the classical stiffnesses to incorporate surface effects. So, the classical finite element model is modified to incorporate surface effects to be in the form  (3.1)  [ [   K   b   \u204e   ] + [   K   s   \u204e   ] + [   K   a   1   ] + [   K   a   2   ] + [   K   a   3   ] ] {   u  0  } = { F }   where [   K   b   \u204e   ] and [   K   s   \u204e   ] are the modified bending and shear classical element stiffness matrices, [   K   a   1   ] , [   K   a   2   ]  and  [   K   a   3   ] are additional element stiffness matrices to incorporate surface effects, {   u  0  } are unknown degrees of freedom and { F } is the applied mechanical force vector. The element stiffness matrices explicitly take the form  (3.2)  [   K   b   \u204e   ] =  \u222b A     [   B   b   ]  T   [   D   b   \u204e   ] [   B   b   ]  d A      (3.3)  [   K   s   \u204e   ] =  \u222b A     [   B   s   ]  T  [   D   s   \u204e   ] [   B   s   ]  d A       (3.4)  [   K   a   1   ] =  \u222b A     [   B   a   1   ]  T  [   D   a   1   ] [   B   a   1   ]   d A      (3.5)  [   K   a   2   ] =  \u222b A     [   B   a   2   ]  T   [   D   a   2   ] [   B   a   1   ]  d A      (3.6)  [   K   a   3   ] =  \u222b A     [   B   a   3   ]  T   [   D   a   3   ] [   B   a   1   ]  d A   where [   B   b   ] and [   B   s   ] are the bending and shear classical strain\u2013displacement matrices, [   B   a   1   ] ,  [   B   a   2   ] and [   B   a   3   ] are additional strain\u2013displacement matrices to incorporate surface effects, [   D   b   \u204e   ] and [   D   s   \u204e   ] are the bending and shear modified equivalent material matrices and [   D   a   1   ] , [   D   a   2   ]  and  [   D   a   3   ] are additional equivalent material matrices to incorporate surface effects. The strain\u2013displacement and equivalent material matrices can be written explicitly in Appendix B.  Once the generalized size-dependent displacements of the nodes are determined, Eq. (2.12) can be used to determine the stress\u2013strain relationship. For the case of small strains, displacements, and rotations, the stresses at any point ( x , y , z ) in a typical element   \u03a9  e  can be computed from the equations  (3.7)   {        \u03c3   x x   \u204e           \u03c3   y y   \u204e           \u03c3   x y   \u204e        }  =  {        \u03c3   x x   c           \u03c3   y y   c           \u03c3   x y   c        }  +  {        \u03c3   x x   a           \u03c3   y y   a           \u03c3   x y   a        }       (3.8)   {        \u03c3   y z   \u204e           \u03c3   x z   \u204e        }  =  [         Q \u00af    44   ( z )        Q \u00af    45   ( z )          Q \u00af    45   ( z )        Q \u00af    55   ( z )      ]   {   \u2211  j = 1  9   [     1   0     0   1     ]   [         0   0      \u03c8   j , x   e         \u03c8   j   e      0     0   0      \u03c8   j , y   e      0      \u03c8   j   e            ]   {        u   j   \u204e           v   j   \u204e           \u03c9   j   \u204e           S   j   1 \u204e           S   j   2 \u204e        }   }    where   \u03c3   i j   c   are the modified classical stresses based on the classical continuum model,   \u03c3   i j   a   are the additional stresses due to incorporating surface effects,   \u03c3   i j   \u204e   are the size-dependent stresses and   {   u   j   \u204e     v   j   \u204e     \u03c9   j   \u204e     S   j   1 \u204e     S   j   2 \u204e   }  T  are the generalized size-dependent displacements of the nodes (see Appendix B).  In this section, the effect of surface energy and the effect of neutral plane position on the FG plate behavior are discussed. The obtained finite element model is used here to compare between the continuum analysis of simply supported FG ultra-thin plates with and without incorporating surface effects.  Here in this section, the analyses of functionally graded (FG) plates are performed for a combination of materials of type ceramic\u2013metal. The lower plate surface is assumed to be aluminum while the top surface is assumed to be zirconia. Material properties parameter n = [ 0  , 2 ] is considered. Physical material properties are given in Table 1. An all edges simply supported square plate, of side a  =  0.2   m and thickness h = 0.01  m is taken for study, where surface energy effects can be neglected. The plate is subjected to a uniformly distributed mechanical transverse load on the top surface.  The neutral plane is located at the plane of zero stress and, for FG plates, is shifted from the geometrical mid-plan, which divides the geometrical thickness of the plate. To study the effect of neutral plane position, the neutral plane shift from the mid-plane must be predetermined. Fig. 2 shows the effect of the grading parameter n on the position of the neutral plane of the plate for different   E   U   /   E   L   ratios. The upper surface modulus of elasticity,   E   U   , equals 151  GPa . It can be noted that the non-dimensional shift (   h   0   / h ) changes with the variation of the grading parameter n . Moreover, the figure shows an increase in the non-dimensional shift (   h   0   / h ) by increasing the grading parameter n , until it reaches its maximum non-dimensional value, then a decrease in non-dimensional shift is provided by increasing the grading parameter n . Moreover, the non-dimensional shift increases by increasing   E   U   /   E   L   ratios.    Fig. 3 shows the non-dimensional central deflection of a FG plate, subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse mechanical load on the top surface. From Fig. 3, it can be noticed that the central deflection of the FG plate (of the previous example) decreases noticeably by raising the value of the material parameter ( n ), because of the increasing of the material rigidity. The rigidity of the material increases by increasing the volume fraction of ceramic, as a consequence of raising the value of ( n ). Table 2 shows the numerical results of a set of numerical simulations with different values of ( n ). The table shows a difference in central deflection while considering and neglecting neutral plane position. The plate provides a higher central deflection when considering neutral plane position rather than the mid-plane of the plate. The results of Fig. 3a are consistent with those presented in Croce and Venini [44].  The variation of the axial stress   \u03c3   x x   at the center of the FG plate and along the thickness direction, for different values of the material parameter n , is shown in Fig. 4. The stress of power law FGM (P-FGM) plate can be represented as a cubic function of z for material parameter n = 2 . The maximum tensile stress along the thickness of the FG plate is located at the bottom edge ( z  =  h / 2 ) and increases as the ratio   E   U   /   E   L   increases. However, the maximum compressive stress is occurred at the top surface ( z  =  \u2212  h / 2 ) and is high for small   E   U   /   E   L   . For the ratio   E   U   /   E   L    = 1 in which the FGM plate becomes a homogenous isotropic plate, the stress distribution is a linear function of z and the maximum stress value is occurred at the top and bottom surfaces of the plate. The neutral-plane \u2013 where zero axial stress is located \u2013 is shifted from the mid-plane to the top surface, (Fig. 4b), by variation of grading parameter n while for isotropic homogenous plate; the zero stress is located at the mid-plane. The results of Fig. 4a are consistent with those presented by Croce and Venini [44], where they assumed that neutral plane coincides with the mid-plane.  In this section, two numerical examples are performed for two cases of isotropic FG plates of side lengths a  and  b and of thickness h . The plate is expected to be functionally graded according to the simple power law of the two constituent materials. The plate is subjected to a sinusoidal transverse distributed mechanical load of intensity p .  Two sets of simply supported boundary conditions are used in the computational solution of rectangular FG plates subjected to sinusoidal distributed loads (see Fig. 5).  The following points will be discussed during the present numerical simulations:  1. Study of effect of the grading parameter n on the FG plate response.  Study of effect neutral plane position on the ultra-thin FG plate response.  Study of effect of aspect ratio a / b on the FG plate response.  The FG plate for Case 1 is expected to be made of silicon (Si) at the upper surface and aluminum (Al) at the lower surface. Table 3 shows the bulk material properties and the surface properties of Al and Si.  An Al/Si infinitely wide isotropic FG plate of length a and of thickness h ( a / h = 10 ) is assumed to study the effect of grading parameter n on its response. The plate is subjected to a sinusoidal load of intensity p = 1   Pa .    Fig. 6 shows the non-dimensional difference between central deflection predicted by the size-dependent model (continuum model incorporating surface effects) and the classical continuum model (neglecting surface effects) ( (   \u03c9  \u204e  \u2212   \u03c9   0   ) /   \u03c9   0   ) for different grading material parameter n of the FG plate based on Mindlin hypotheses. The results agree with that obtained at [42]. The figure shows that the FG and homogenous films provide negative non-dimensional differences in deflection, which means that surface tensions stiffen the films. Also, the surface tension of Al is higher than that of Si, so the non-dimensional differences for Al are higher than that of Si. Increasing the grading parameter n reduces the non-dimensional differences in deflection, this is for FG plate whose upper surface tension is smaller than its lower surface tension.    Fig. 7 shows the non-dimensional stress distribution through the FG plate thickness for different grading parameter n and plate thicknesses based on Mindlin plate theory. The plate is infinitely wide and simply supported according to the boundary conditions illustrated at Fig. 5a. The non-dimensional axial stresses (    \u03c3 \u00af    x x   =   \u03c3   x x   / p ) are calculated at the center point ( x = a / 2 ) for different plate thicknesses. Fig. 7a shows a linear distribution for axial stress. For grading parameters more than zero, a nonlinear distribution is presented. The axial stresses are shown to be compressive at top surface and tensile at bottom surface of the plate. The figure shows that surface tensions stiffen the plate, and hence reduce the plate axial stresses. These stresses decrease gradually by decreasing the plate thickness. Also, the neutral plane moves upward to the upper surface, where higher Young's modulus, although it has lower surface tension. The figure shows, for isotropic plates the neutral plane coincides with the geometrical mid-plane of the plate. While for FG plates the neutral plane position is independent on the plate surface properties and plate thickness because of the applied boundary conditions.  The FG plate for Case 2 is expected to be made of Material II at the upper surface and Material I at the lower surface. Table 4 shows the bulk material properties and the surface properties of Material II and Material I.  Consider a cylindrical bending of an infinitely wide FG plate, made of Material II and Material I, of length a , and of thickness h . The length-to-thickness ratio is expected to be a / h = 10 and the plate is subjected to a sinusoidal load of intensity p = 1   Pa . Fig. 8 shows the non-dimensional difference between central deflection predicted by the size-dependent finite element model and the classical finite element model ( (   \u03c9  \u204e  \u2212   \u03c9   0   ) /   \u03c9   0   ). The results agree with the analytical results obtained at [43]. The figure shows that the FG and homogenous films provide negative non-dimensional differences in deflection, which means that surface tensions stiffen the films. Also, the non-dimensional differences in deflection for homogenous films (Material II and Material I) with different surface properties (d) and the same surface properties (s) are shown. For Material II (d) film, of different surface properties, there will be differences in central deflections unlike that of the same surface properties Material II (s). Increasing the grading parameter n reduces the non-dimensional differences in deflection, this is for FG plates whose upper surface tension is smaller than its lower surface tension.      Figs. 9\u201311 show the non-dimensional stress distribution through the FG plate thickness for different grading parameter n and plate thicknesses based on Mindlin plate theory. The plate is infinitely wide and simply supported according to the boundary conditions illustrated at Fig. 5b. The non-dimensional axial stresses (    \u03c3 \u00af    x x   =   \u03c3   x x   / p ) are calculated at the center point ( x = a / 2 ) for different plate thicknesses. Fig. 9 shows a linear distribution for axial stress. For grading parameters more than zero, a nonlinear distribution is presented. The axial stresses are shown to be compressive at top surface and tensile at bottom surface of the plate. The figures show that, surface tensions stiffen the plate, hence reduce the plate axial stresses. These stresses decrease gradually by decreasing the plate thickness. The figures show, for isotropic plates with different surface properties the neutral plane moves to the lower surface. While for FG plates the neutral plane position depends on the plate surface properties and the bulk material properties. For larger thicknesses, where surface energy effects can be neglected, the neutral plane moves to the surface whose Young's modulus is higher. While decreasing plate thickness moves the neutral plane downward to the bottom surface, where higher surface tension, although it has lower Young's modulus. This is due to the big difference between surface tensions of plate surfaces. There is a difference between results of the model when neglecting and considering neutral plane position. These differences increase by decreasing the plate thickness. The results of the model while neglecting neutral plane position are consistent with that obtained at [42].  Now, consider a simply supported rectangular plate of side lengths a  and  b and of thickness h . The plate is subjected to a sinusoidal distributed load of intensity p . The plate is expected to be made of Material II at the upper surface and Material I at the lower surface (Case 2). The following non-dimensional parameters are introduced for use within the numerical simulations to be presented next (here p denotes the intensity of the applied mechanical load and   E   L   is the Young's modulus at the bottom face (Material I)):   Central  deflection   \u03c9 \u00af   =    \u03c9  \u204e  / h Non - dimensional  load  intensity   P \u00af  =   100 ( 1 \u2212   \u03c5  2  ) p     E   L            Fig. 12 shows the non-dimensional central deflection (at x = a / 2 and y = b / 2 ) versus non-dimensional load intensity  P \u00af  for different plate thicknesses and different grading parameter n . Fig. 12a, shows size-dependent deflections for micro-scale plate thicknesses. Increasing the non-dimensional load intensity increases the deflection, while reducing the plate thickness reduces its deflection due to the increase in its surface tension effects. Fig. 12b, shows the effect of grading material parameter n on the plate's deflections, while varying the non-dimensional load intensity. The figure shows a decrease in plate deflection while increasing the grading parameter n .    Fig. 13 shows the non-dimensional maximum axial stress ( x = a / 2 and y = b / 2 ) distribution through the plate thickness ( a = b = 10  h ) for different plate thicknesses and different grading parameter n . The plate is simply supported according to the boundary conditions illustrated at Fig. 5a. For n = 0 , a linear distribution of the axial stress through the plate thickness is provided for that homogenous material. While for FG plates a nonlinear distribution is involved depending on the value of the grading parameter n . It is shown that, for micro-scale plate thicknesses the surface effects become significant, while for macro-scale thicknesses the stress distribution closes the classical continuum model distribution. The axial stresses are shown to be compressive at top surface and tensile at bottom surface of the plate. The figures show that, surface tensions stiffen the plate, hence reduce the plate axial stresses. These stresses decrease gradually by decreasing the plate thickness. Also, decreasing plate thickness moves the neutral plane upward to the upper surface, where higher Young's modulus, although it has lower surface tension. The figures show, for FG plates the neutral plane position is independent on the plate surface properties and plate thickness because of the applied boundary conditions.    Fig. 14 shows the effect of aspect ratio a / b on the deflection of a rectangular FG plate for different plate thicknesses and different grading parameter n . The plate width is held at b = 10  h . The maximum deflection increases with the increase in the aspect ratio up to 4 for macro-scale thicknesses. For micro-scale thicknesses the aspect ratio effect reduces by reducing the plate thickness. Also, the effect of grading parameter n on the plate deflection for different aspect ratios is presented at Fig. 14b. The figure shows that increasing the grading parameter n decreases the plate deflection.    Fig. 15 shows the non-dimensional axial stress distribution (    \u03c3 \u00af    x x   ) through the plate thickness for different aspect ratios. The plate is functionally graded n = 2 , of thickness h = 1 \u00d7   10   \u2212 7    m and simply supported according to the boundary conditions illustrated at Fig. 5a. The figure shows that, increasing the aspect ratio reduces the induced stresses. Also, the position of the neutral plane is independent on the aspect ratio of the plate, which means that the position of the neutral plane depends mainly on the plate material properties and the plate thickness for very small thicknesses. This conclusion is consistent with that obtained by Chi and Chung [45].   CONCLUSIONS   In this paper, a finite element model is developed based on Mindlin plate theory for continuum incorporating surface energy to study the behavior of ultra-thin functionally graded (FG) Mindlin plates. A set of continuum governing differential equations which include intrinsic length scales and modified equivalent material stiffnesses are derived. A simply supported micro/nano scaled films subjected to a transverse mechanical load are discussed. Also, a parametric study is provided to investigate effects of surface energy and neutral plane position on the FG plate response. The numerical results lead to the following conclusions:  1. For ultra-thin plates, the size-dependent effects of surface energy on the behavior are much more significant than that obtained for macro-scale plates. The modified Mindlin plate theory, incorporating surface energy effects, presented in this paper, has a size dependent length parameter and can predict surface energy effects. On contrary, the classical continuum elasticity cannot predict those effects since it does not have any size dependent length parameter.  The size effect becomes significant as the plate thickness decreases and approaches its intrinsic thickness.  The surface energy could stiffen or soften the plate material stiffness depending on surface material properties.  For the FG plates, the position of the neutral plane may not coincide with the mid-plane of the plate. The position of neutral plane may have a significant effect on the behavior of FG plates and should be taken into account.  For very small plate thicknesses the neutral plane position depends on the plate surface properties and the bulk properties of the plate. While for larger thicknesses, where surface effects can be neglected, the neutral plane moves to the surface whose Young's modulus is higher.  For FG plates, the position of the neutral plane is independent on the plate aspect ratio.  For macro-scale thicknesses the aspect ratio has a great effect on the plate response, while for micro/nano-scale thicknesses the effect of aspect ratio is no longer dominant like the effect of surface tension.  If the top and bottom surface layers have different material properties, the resultant forces and moments can be obtained by substituting the displacement fields and the strain components (Eq.

The size-dependent mechanical response is very important while the plate thickness reduces to micro/nano scales. The classical finite element model is adopted to allow insertion of the surface energy into the total energy of the plate. Bulk stresses on the surfaces are required to satisfy the surface balance conditions involving surface stresses. Therefore, unlike the classical continuum plate models, the bulk transverse normal stress is preserved here. Moreover, unlike most of previous studies in the literature, the exact neutral plane position is pre-determined and considered for FG plates. A series of continuum governing differential equations which include surface energy and neutral plane position effects are derived. A comparison between the continuum analysis of FG ultra-thin plates with and without incorporating surface energy effects is presented."}
