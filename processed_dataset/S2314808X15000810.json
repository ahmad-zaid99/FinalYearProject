Characterization by IR, 1H NMR and MS spectroscopic techniques.      Potential cytotoxicity study against larynx epidermoid carcinoma (Hep2).          KEYPHRASES   5-Aminopyrazole  Phenyl isothiocyanate  Formic acid  Thiourea  Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidines  Antitumor activity  Epidermoid carcinoma   Pyrazole derivatives are characterized by their biological and pharmacological activities as potential inhibitors of HIV-1 [1], pesticides [2], fungicides [3], antihypertensive agents [4] and anticancer activity [5]. They are also important and useful precursors for the synthesis of other fused heterocyclic systems, among these pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives [6], which have a considerable chemical and pharmacological importance as purine analogues [7\u20139]. In the literature, it was found that the replacement of 1H of pyrazole of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine ring system by some other bioactive moieties drastically alters its pharmacological properties [10]. Also, the pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives represent important building blocks in both natural and synthetic bioactive compounds [11]. They show anxiolytic activity along with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, cholesterol formation inhibitor, and anti-Alzheimer [12]. Moreover, fused heterocyclic containing pyrazolopyridine systems have been described to be associated with several biological and medicinal activities [13\u201316]. In the present work, some new 1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives incorporating the tosyl moiety were synthesized to evaluate their potential cytotoxicity against epidermoid carcinoma of the larynx (Hep2).  All melting points (uncorrected) were determined on an electrothermal Gallenkamp melting point apparatus. The IR spectra were recorded in KBr disks on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS 50 FT-IR spectrometer (not all frequencies are reported). The NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker WP 300 spectrometer at 300\u2009MHz using TMS as an internal standard and DMSO-d6 as solvent. The mass spectra were performed using a LC-MS (Shimadzu-Mass spectrometer) at 70\u2009eV. Elemental analyses were carried out at the Microanalytical Unit, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt; the results were in satisfactory agreement with the calculated values.  To a cold solution of p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (0.05\u2009mol, 9.3\u2009g) in 50\u2009ml ethanol, tetracyanoethylene (0.05\u2009mol, 6.4\u2009g) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then heated under reflux on a steam bath for 30 minutes. The mixture was then cooled and the white precipitate was collected and washed with ethanol.

Epidermoid carcinoma (larynx) Hep2 was obtained from ATCC via a holding company for biological products and vaccines (VACSERA), Cairo, Egypt. 5-Fluorouracil was used as a standard anticancer drug for comparison.  The reagents were RPMI-1640 medium, MTT, DMSO and 5-fluorouracil (Sigma Co., St. Louis, USA), and fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, UK).  The cell line mentioned above was utilized to determine the inhibitory effects of compounds on cell growth utilizing the MTT test. This colorimetric test is based on the transformation of the yellow 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) to a purple formazan derivative by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase in practical cells. Hep2 was refined in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. The anti-toxins included were 100 units/ml penicillin and 100\u2009\u00b5g/ml streptomycin at 37\u2009\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The cell line was seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1\u2009\u00d7\u2009104 cells/well [19] at 37\u2009\u00b0C for 48 hours under 5% CO2.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in volume of 100\u2009\u00b5l is added into each well to dissolve the purple formazan formed. The colorimetric test is measured and recorded at the absorbance of 570\u2009nm utilizing a plate reader (EXL 800, USA). The relative cell viability in percentage was ascertained as: (A570 of treated samples/A570 of untreated sample)\u2009\u00d7\u2009100.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   The key starting material 5-amino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile (2) was synthesized in 80% yield by refluxing p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (1) with tetracyanoethylene in absolute ethanol [17]. The ease synthesis and expected biological activity of the starting compound prompted us to prepare some 3-cyano-1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine and 3-cyano-1-tosyl-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives starting from available and inexpensive compounds such as carbon disulfide, thiourea, formic acid and ethyl acetoacetate. Thus, heating of the pyrazole compound 2 with carbon disulfide in pyridine for 12 hours furnished the corresponding 4,6-dithioxo-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative 3 in good yield (Scheme\u20091 ). The chemical structure of 3 was secured by its correct elemental analysis and spectral data. Its IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3437 and 2221\u2009cm\u22121 for the imino (NH) and nitrile (CN) functions. The 1 H NMR spectrum revealed singlet signal at 2.25\u2009ppm for methyl protons (CH3), two doublet signals at 7.10 and 7.50\u2009ppm for para-disubstituted benzene ring, and two singlet signals at NH at 11.22 and 13.69\u2009ppm for two imine protons (NH). The reaction of pyrazole compound 2 with phenyl isothiocyanate proceeded by heating under reflux in dimethyl formamide to afford the corresponding 4-imino-5-phenyl-6-thioxo-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine derivative 4.

Heating of compound 2 with triethyl orthoformate in acetic anhydride afforded ethyl N-(3,4-dicyano-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)formimidate 9, which underwent heterocyclization with hydrazine hydrate in absolute ethanol, afforded 5-amino-4-imino-1-tosyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile 10 in good yield. The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3342 and 3216\u2009cm\u22121 for the (NH and NH2) groups, 2236\u2009cm\u22121 due to the presence of nitrile (CN) function and 1635\u2009cm\u22121 for the (CN) group.

Heating of compound 2 with ethyl acetoacetate in dimethyl formamide in the presence of an equimolar amount of potassium carbonate gave one spot on TLC using ethyl acetate:petroleum ether mixture (2:3) as eluent, the obtained product was identified as 5-Acetyl-4-amino-6-hydroxy-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo-[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (12) on the basis of elemental and spectral analyses (Scheme\u20093 ). The formation of 12 was proposed to be continued through heterocyclization of the expected intermediate 5-acetyl-4-amino-6-hydroxy-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3-carbonitrile (11). The IR spectrum showed absorption bands at 3293, 3201 and 3140\u2009cm\u22121 for (OH and NH2) groups, 2240\u2009cm\u22121 corresponding to nitrile function (CN), 1702\u2009cm\u22121 due to CO group and 1648\u2009cm\u22121 referring to (CN) function.

The mass spectrum showed the molecular ion peak at m/z\u2009=\u2009371 corresponding to the molecular weight of the molecular formula C16H13N5O4S.  Heating of compound 2 with malononitrile in refluxing DMF containing piperidine produces a sole product that identified as 4,6-diamino-1-tosyl-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile 13, in 67% isolated yield. Presumably, ionized malononitrile attacks the cyano group in compound 2 before the amino group of the latter attacks one of the malononitrile cyano groups resulting in ring formation. The IR spectrum showed absorption peaks at 3410, 3335 and 3245\u2009cm\u22121 due to the presence of amino groups (NH2), 2216\u2009cm\u22121 due to the nitrile function (CN) and 1651\u2009cm\u22121 corresponding to (CN) function. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibited singlet signal at 2.40\u2009ppm corresponding to the methyl protons (CH3), two singlet signals at 6.42 and 8.47\u2009ppm for the two amino groups (NH2), while the doublet signals at 7.42 and 7.61\u2009ppm were assigned for the aromatic protons.  The antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds were evaluated against human laryngeal epidermoid carcinoma cell line (Hep2) using the MTT assay method. The results acquired in Table\u00a01 demonstrated that compounds 3 (IC50 36.9\u2009\u00b5M) and 4 (IC50 21.3\u2009\u00b5M) have the highly significant effect compared to the standard anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (IC50 41.5\u2009\u00b5M). This may be because of the presence of such NH-CS moiety in addition to the N-tosyl-pyrazolo-pyrimidine moiety in the two compounds. The other compounds showed low impact against epidermoid carcinoma (Hep2).
