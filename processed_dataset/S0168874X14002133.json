A new simple first-order shear deformation plate theory is used.      The effects of boundary conditions, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, etc. on geometrically nonlinear responses of plates are investigated.      The proposed approach with several advantages is effective, highly accurate, free of shear-locking, etc. in geometrically nonlinear analysis.          KEYPHRASES   Functionally graded plates  Geometric nonlinearity  Isogeometric analysis  First-order shear deformation theory  Shear locking   Functionally graded materials (FGM) with high temperature resistance, wear resistance and corrosion resistance have been widely used in various engineering structures. A large number of practical problems of FGM structures including functionally graded (FG) plates and shells require a geometrically nonlinear formulation, such as the post-buckling behavior, load carrying capacity of structures used in aeronautical, aerospace as well as in mechanical and civil engineering. In such cases, linear finite element models are not able to predict the structural response accurately. Hence, the development of efficient and accurate nonlinear finite element models becomes crucial.  As the shear deformation that has significant effects on the responses of FG plates, numerous shear deformation theories have been applied to analyze the mechanical behaviors of FG plates. The higher-order shear deformation theories (HSDTs) [1\u20134] can obtain higher accurate and stable solutions, but they require the C 1 continuity for the generalized displacements, and most importantly their computational costs are rather high. The first-order shear deformation plate theory (FSDT) [5] requires only C 0 inter element continuity but it suffers from the shear locking effects for thin plates. Recently, a simple FSDT (S-FSDT) was formulated in [6,7] by partitioning the transverse deflection into the bending and shear components. Compared with the traditional FSDT, one unknown can be saved and the shear locking is free in the S-FSDT. However, the S-FSDT requires C 1 continuity of the generalized displacements leading to the second-order derivative of the stiffness formulation which is awkward in conventional finite element analysis based on the C 0 continuity. In fact, the employment of bending and shear components was first proposed by Huffington [8], later adopted by Chen and Yang [9] for beams, extended by Raciti and Kapania [10] for nonlinear vibrations of unsymmetrically laminated beams and recently by Thai et al. [6,7,11] for composite plates. However, one of disadvantages can be easily observed in those papers that too many unknown variables are used in the framework of the conventional finite element method (FEM) due to the need for the C 1 continuity. It was stated in [11] that there are 10 degrees of freedom (DOFs) per node used. In this contribution, we propose an effectively alternative way for geometrically nonlinear formulation based on the S-FSDT and the NURBS-based isogeometric analysis. It motivates us because of the higher-order continuity of NURBS basis and the effective formulation of the S-FSDT theory in saving one unknown variable compared to the traditional one. By this new approach, a C 1 S-FSDT geometrically nonlinear formulation can be easily achieved, and more importantly, only four DOFs per node are required.  The isogeometric analysis (IGA) introduced in [12] has devoted to be an efficient and useful numerical method as its main ideas are to adopt the CAD basis functions (e.g., the NURBS) to be the shape functions in the finite element analysis. It thus offers the possibility of achieving a seamless integration between the finite element analysis and the CAD. The IGA inherently owns many advantage features including the exact geometrical modeling, higher-order continuity, simple meshing and mesh refinement, etc. At present, it has been successfully applied in many engineering applications, for instance, structural mechanics [13\u201318], fracture mechanic problem [19], unsaturated flow problem in porous media [20], contact analysis [21], and structural shape optimization [22]. Numerical results presented in most of the previous studies have shown that superior accuracy can be obtained by the IGA method.  In recent years, the meshless methods have introduced (e.g., see [23\u201325]) to alleviate drawbacks encountered in mesh-based methods. They are one of the techniques to deal with this type of geometrically nonlinear problems and FGM effectively, and curious and interested readers may typically refer to [26\u201331] for more information.  We present in this paper a novel approach based on the S-FSDT theory and the IGA with four DOFs per node for efficiently and accurately studying geometrically nonlinear behaviors of both thin and moderately thick homogeneous and non-homogeneous functionally graded plates (FGPs). This new formulation makes use of all the advantage features of the IGA and the S-FSDT theory and it also can be utilized for other homogeneous or non-homogeneous composite plate structures. Geometric nonlinearity is accounted for in von-Karman strain sense including membrane-bending coupling. The Newton\u2013Raphson iterative scheme is integrated into the approach, which is then used to solve the system of nonlinear equations.  It is interesting to point out some typical advantages of the proposed approach dominated over the traditional ones. It is an effective numerical method indeed since it is shown later that accurate modeling in geometrically nonlinear behaviors of plates can be obtained. The advantage features are, for instance, (a) the new S-FSDT used in the present formulation saves one unknown less than that of the conventional FSDT; (b) more importantly, our new element approach based on IGA and S-FSDT considers only four DOFs per node while it indicates in [11] that about 10 DOFs per node are used in the traditional FEM; (c) the new S-FSDT is free of shear-locking; (d) the awkward C 1 continuity required for the generalized displacements is treated straightforwardly because of the nature of the higher-order continuity IGA method. These features are illustrated in the numerical examples, and in this paper, we consider several numerical examples of homogeneous and non-homogeneous FGPs using the present method. The effects of the boundary condition, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the geometrically nonlinear responses of the FGPs are investigated. We will later show on the numerical results that the method is highly accurate, efficient, free of the shear-locking, etc. in modeling the geometrically nonlinearity of the FGPs. The computed results obtained by the present formulation match well with the reference solutions.  The paper is structured as follows. A brief review on the theoretical formulation of the FGPs is presented in Section 2. The S-FSDT-based IGA for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of the FGPs is described in Section 3. In Section 4, accuracy study by the numerical validation is presented. The numerical results derived from the S-FSDT-based IGA are then presented and discussed in Section 5. We shall end with some conclusions drawn in Section 6.  Let us consider a ceramic\u2013metal FGM plate with thickness t , and the metal and the ceramic are manufactured to be located on the bottom and the top faces of the plate, respectively. According to the FSDT, the displacement fields can be expressed as  (1)     u  (  x , y , z  )  =   u   0    (  x , y  )  + z   \u03d5   x    (  x , y  )      v  (  x , y , z  )  =   v   0    (  x , y  )  + z   \u03d5   y    (  x , y  )      w  (  x , y , z  )  =   w   0    (  x , y  )       where   u   0   ,   v   0   , and   w   0   respectively represent the displacements at the mid-plane of the plate in the x, y, and z directions;   \u03d5   x   and   \u03d5   y   are the transverse normal rotations about the y and x axes, respectively.  It is assumed in the S-FSDT theory that the transverse displacement   w   0   is divided into the bending component   w   b   and the shear component   w   s   , which means that   w   0   =   w   b   +   w   s   ; and   \u03d5   x   = \u2212 \u2202   w   b   / \u2202 x ,   \u03d5   y   = \u2212 \u2202   w   b   / \u2202 y . Thus, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as  (2)     u  (  x , y , z  )  =   u   0    (  x , y  )  \u2212 z   \u2202   w   b    (  x , y  )    \u2202 x       v  (  x , y , z  )  =   v   0    (  x , y  )  \u2212 z   \u2202   w   b    (  x , y  )    \u2202 y       w  (  x , y , z  )  =   w   b    (  x , y  )  +   w   s    (  x , y  )       Eq. (2) describes the displacement fields of the S-FSDT [6,7,11,18], with which it is found that (1) the displacement fields only contain four unknowns of   u   0   ,    v   0   ,    w   b   ,    w   s   , (2) compared with the original FSDT, one unknown is saved, (3) the C 1-continuity of the bending component   w   b   is required for the new formulation, (4) by partitioning of the transverse displacement it can be stated that the S-FSDT theory is free of the shear-locking. It would be interesting to see that the S-FSDT may be considered as an intermediate state between the Kirchhoff plate and the classical FSDT plate [18]. As for the thin plates the shear component   w   s   is small and it can be neglected, by which the theory approaches to the Kirchhoff plate. However, the shear component   w   s   cannot be ignored for the thick plates and the results are converges to classical FSDT plate.  The nonlinear strain\u2013displacement relations of the plates are given by [26]   (3)  \u03b5 =  {        \u03b5   x           \u03b5   y           \u03b3   x y           \u03b3   x z           \u03b3   y z        }  =  {        \u2202 u   \u2202 x   +  1 2    (    \u2202 w   \u2202 x    )  2          \u2202 v   \u2202 y   +  1 2    (    \u2202 w   \u2202 y    )  2          \u2202 u   \u2202 y   +   \u2202 v   \u2202 x   +   \u2202 w   \u2202 x     \u2202 w   \u2202 y           \u2202 w   \u2202 x   +   \u2202 u   \u2202 z           \u2202 w   \u2202 y   +   \u2202 v   \u2202 z        }       Substituting Eq.

In this work, the Young\u05f3s modulus E and Poisson\u05f3s ratio \u03bd are assumed to vary through the thickness with a power law distribution as follows:  (9)  E  ( z )  =   E   m   +  (    E   c   \u2212   E   m    )    (   1 2  +  z t   )  n       (10)  \u03bd  ( z )  =   \u03bd   m   +  (    \u03bd   c   \u2212   \u03bd   m    )    (   1 2  +  z t   )  n    where n is the gradient index; while z is the thickness coordinate variable with \u2212  t / 2  \u2264 z \u2264  t / 2  ; and subscripts c and m respectively denote the ceramic and metal constituents.  In the parametric space \u03be \u2208  [  0 , 1  ]  , the knot vector k  ( \u03be )  is a set of non-decreasing numbers which are between zero and one. With the given knot vector k  ( \u03be )  , the ith B-spline basis function of degree p, written as   N   i , p    ( \u03be )  , is defined recursively as follows [32]:  (11)    N   i , 0   ( \u03be ) =  {     1    if    \u03be   i   \u2264 \u03be <   \u03be   i + 1        0    otherwise        for  p = 0   and  (12)    N   i , p   ( \u03be ) =   \u03be \u2212   \u03be   i       \u03be   i + p   \u2212   \u03be   i       N   i , p \u2212 1   ( \u03be ) +     \u03be   i + p + 1   \u2212 \u03be     \u03be   i + p + 1   \u2212   \u03be   i + 1       N   i + 1 , p \u2212 1   ( \u03be )  for  p \u2265 1      Taking the tensor product of two one-dimensional B-spline basis functions, the two-dimensional NURBS basis functions can be obtained as follows:  (13)    R   i , j   p , q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 ) =     N   i , p   ( \u03be )   N   j , q   ( \u03b7 )   w   i , j      \u2211  i = 1  n    \u2211  j = 1  m     N   i , p   ( \u03be )   N   j , q   ( \u03b7 )   w   i , j         where   w   i , j   are the weight;   N   j , q   ( \u03b7 ) is the B-spline basis function of order q in the \u03b7 direction, and it follows the recursive formula shown in Eqs. (11) and (12) with the knot vector k ( \u03b7 ) .  By using the NURBS basis functions, a NURBS surface of order p in the \u03be direction and order q in the \u03b7 direction can be constructed as  (14)  S  (  \u03be , \u03b7  )  =  \u2211  i = 1  n    \u2211  j = 1  m     R   i , j   p , q    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )    B   i , j       where   B   i , j   are the coordinates of the control points.  The geometrical discretization in the IGA is expressed as  (15)  x =  \u2211  I = 1  n     R   I    ( \u03be )    x   I      where \u03be is the parametric coordinate;   R   I    ( \u03be )  and   x   I   are the shape functions and coordinates at the control point I while n is the number of the control points.  In a similar manner, the displacements in the middle plane are approximated as  (16)    u   0   h   =  \u2211  I = 1   N P      R   I     u   I      with  (17a)    u   0   h   =   [        u   0   h         v   0   h         w   b   h         w   s   h        ]  T       (17b)    u   I   =   [        u   I         v   I         w   b I         w   s I        ]  T    where N P = ( p + 1 ) ( q + 1 ) is the total number of the control points per element, and   u   I   is the unknown displacement vector at the control point I .  Substituting Eq. (16) into Eq. (5), it leads to  (18)  \u03b5 = B   u  e    where   u  e  =   [        u   1         u   2      \u2026      u   N P        ]  T  is the displacement vector at control points in one element, and B is the strain matrix of element which is defined as  (19)  B =  {       B   m       0     }  +  {     z   B   b         B   s       }  +  {       1 2   A   B   n l       0     }    with  (20a)    B   m   =  [        B   m   1      \u22ef      B   m   i      \u22ef      B   m   N P        ]  ;    B   m   i   =  [        \u2202   R   i     \u2202 x      0   0   0     0      \u2202   R   i     \u2202 y      0   0        \u2202   R   i     \u2202 y         \u2202   R   i     \u2202 x      0   0     ]       (20b)    B   b   =  [        B   b   1      \u22ef      B   b   i      \u22ef      B   b   N P        ]  ;    B   b   i   =  [     0   0        \u2202  2    R   i     \u2202   x  2       0     0   0        \u2202  2    R   i     \u2202   y  2       0     0   0    2     \u2202  2    R   i     \u2202 x \u2202 y      0     ]       (20c)    B   s   =  [        B   s   1      \u22ef      B   s   i      \u22ef      B   s   N P        ]  ,    B   s   i   =  [     0   0   0      \u2202   R   i     \u2202 x        0   0   0      \u2202   R   i     \u2202 y        ]       (20d)    B   n l   =  [        B   n l   1      \u22ef      B   n l   i      \u22ef      B   n l   N P        ]  ;    B   n l   i   =  [     0   0      \u2202   R   i     \u2202 x         \u2202   R   i     \u2202 x        0   0      \u2202   R   i     \u2202 y         \u2202   R   i     \u2202 y        ]       (20e)  A =  [      (    \u2202   w   b     \u2202 x   +   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 x    )    0     0    (    \u2202   w   b     \u2202 y   +   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 y    )       (    \u2202   w   b     \u2202 y   +   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 y    )     (    \u2202   w   b     \u2202 x   +   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 x    )      ]       The relation between the incremental strains and the incremental displacements are given by  (21)  d \u03b5 =  B  \u00af   d   u  e       Substituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (21) leads to  (22)   B  \u00af   =  {        B   m        0     }  +  {      z   B   b           B   s        }  +  {      A   B   n l        0     }       According to the virtual work principle, the system of nonlinear discrete equations is obtained as  (23)  \u03c6  ( u )  = K  ( u )  u \u2212 R = 0   where u is the vector of the displacements at control points, while K and R are the global stiffness matrix and the external force vector, respectively. The element contribution to the matrix K and the vector R are as follows:  (24)  k =  \u222b    \u03a9  e        B \u00af    T   D B d \u03a9       (25)    r   i   =   R   i   \u22c5 F +  \u222b    \u03a9  e       R   i   \u22c5 f  d \u03a9 +  \u222b    \u0393   t   e        R   i   \u22c5  f \u00af   d \u0393   where F , f and  f \u00af  represent the concentrated force, body force and surface force, respectively.  Eq. (23) is a nonlinear equation and solved by using the Newton\u2013Raphson iterative method  (26)  \u0394   u   n   = \u2212   K   t   \u2212 1     \u03c6   n        (27)    u   n + 1   =   u   n   + \u0394   u   n        In Eq. (26),   K   t   is the tangent stiffness matrix, and is expressed as  (28)    K   t   =  \u2211  e = 1     N   e      \u222b    (    B   n l    )  T  \u03c3   B   n l   d \u03a9   +  \u2211  e = 1     N   e      \u222b   B  \u00af   D  B  \u00af   d \u03a9     where   N   e   is the total number of elements, and \u03c3 =  [        \u03c3   x         \u03c4   x y           \u03c4   x y         \u03c3   y        ]  is the stress matrix.  The error norm used for convergence is given by  (29)       \u2211  I = 1  N     |    u   I   n + 1   \u2212   u   I   n    |  2      \u2211  I = 1  N     |    u   I   n + 1    |  2       <   10   \u2212 3     where N is the total number of the control points.  To verify the accuracy of the present model, two homogeneous plates and two FGPs are considered using the cubic order S-FSDT-based IGA method. The numerical results obtained are then compared with the reference solutions. In the homogeneous plates, the gradient index n is set to be zero. As for clamped boundary conditions, the rotations are obtained from the derivatives of bending deflection   \u03d5   x   = \u2212 \u2202   w   b   / \u2202 x and   \u03d5   y   = \u2212 \u2202   w   b   / \u2202 y ; thus, the constraint on the rotations is imposed by fixing the z-component of the second row of control points as described in [15].  A clamped square thin plate with length L=100mm and thickness t=1mm under a uniform load   q   0   is considered. The material properties of the plate are E=2.1\u00d7106 N/mm2 and v =0.316. The analytic solution of the central deflection   w   0   is given by [33]   (30)    w   0   = 2.5223   w   1     with  (31)    (      w   1    t   )  3  + 0.2522     w   1    t  = 0.0001333     q   0     L  4    D t     where D =  (   E   t  3   /  12  (  1 \u2212   v  2   )    )  is the bending stiffness.  The whole configuration of the square plate is discretized by a mesh of 16\u00d716 control points as depicted in Fig. 1a, and its physical mesh is also sketched in Fig. 1b. The normalized central deflection  w \u00af  =   w   0   / t with respect to the different normalized load parameter P = (   q   0     L  4  / E   t  4  ) is computed and then compared with the analytic solutions as plotted in Fig. 2. It is evident that the obtained numerical results match well with the analytic solutions, and the shear locking phenomenon is avoided.  A simply supported moderately thick square plate with length L=10in. and thickness t=1in. under a uniform load   q   0   is studied. The material properties of the plate are E=7.8\u00d7106 psi and v =0.3. The normalized center deflection  w \u00af  =   w   0   / t is computed, and compared with those derived from the FSDT-based mixed finite element method [34] and the FSDT-based IGA [35]. Table 1 presents the results of the normalized center deflection accounted for different the normalized load parameters P = (   q   0     L  4  / E   t  4  ) . It can be observed in the results that the  w \u00af  computed from the present method are in good agreement with the other solutions.    Fig. 3 presents the whole CPU time for different meshes and the normalized load parameter P = 25 derived from the IGA method that integrates either the traditional FSDT or the S-FSDT theory. As expected, compared with the FSDT-based IGA, the S-FSDT-based IGA can save time. The saving of the computational time obtained by the S-FSDT may be originally caused by the fact that the number of unknowns in the new formulation is one less than that in the traditional FSDT theory.  Next, a clamped circular thin plate with radius R=1m and thickness t=0.02m under a uniform load   q   0    N/m2 is considered. The material properties of the plate are E=3.0\u00d7107 N/m2 and v =0.3. The analytic solution of the central deflection   w   0   is available through the following equation [33]:  (32)  P =     q   0     R  4    E   t  4    =   16   3  (  1 \u2212   v  2   )     [      w   0    t  +  1  360    (  1 + v  )   (  173 \u2212 73 v  )    (      w   0    t   )  3   ]       A mesh of 121 control points is sketched in Fig. 4. The normalized central deflections  w \u00af  =   w   0   / t are computed using the present S-FSDT-based IGA method, and the achieved results are then plotted altogether with the analytic solutions [33] as depicted in Fig. 5. It is again found that the present method works well as the normalized central deflection is in good agreement with the exact solutions. The shear locking phenomenon is free in this example.  We now consider a simply supported square Ti\u20136Al\u20134V/aluminum oxide plate with length a=0.2m and length-to-thickness ratio a/t=20 subjected to a uniform load   q   0   . The material properties of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V and aluminum oxide are   v   m   = 0.298 ,   E   m   = 105.7  G P a , and   v   c   = 0.26 ,   E   c   = 320.2  G P a , respectively. The normalized center deflection  w \u00af  =   w   0   / t for different normalized load parameters P =   q   0     a  4  /  (    E   m     t  4   )  is calculated using the present S-FSDT-based IGA method. The solutions are accounted for different gradient indices, e.g., n=0 and n=0.5. They are then depicted in Fig. 6 in comparison with those derived from the meshfree methods, the FSDT-based element-free kp-Ritz method [26] and the FSDT-based local Petrov\u2013Galerkin method using the moving Kriging interpolation (PGMK) [27]. As expected, high accuracy of the nonlinear responses of the FGPs for the present method is found, which further confirm its correctness. Importantly, it is interesting to see that a significant effect of the gradient index on the geometrical nonlinear responses is found in Fig. 6.  Another simply supported square plate made of Al\u2013ZrO2 with length a=0.2m and length-to-thickness ratio a/t=20, subjected to a uniform transverse loading   q   0   =\u22121\u00d7104 N/m2, is considered. The material properties of Al and ZrO2 are   v   m   = 0.3 ,   E   m   = 70  G P a , and   v   c   = 0.3 ,   E   c   = 151  G P a , respectively. Similarly, the normalized axial stress    \u03c3 \u00af    x   = (   \u03c3   x     a  2  /   E   m     t  2  ) through the thickness of the plate with n=0.5 and n=2 are computed by the developed method, and compared with those from the aforementioned meshfree methods [26,27]. This comparison is depicted in Fig. 7, which shows highly accurate on the axial stresses through the thickness of the plate derived from the present formulation.  A circular Al\u2013ZrO2 FGM plate with radius R=1m and thickness t=0.1m subjected to a uniform transverse load   q   0   is additionally considered to verify the applicability of the present method. The material properties of Al and ZrO2 are already given in Section 4.3. For comparison purpose, this problem is also solved using the ANSYS finite element software package. With different normalized load parameter P =   q   0     R  4  /  (    E   m     t  4   )  , Table 2 tabulates the computed results of the normalized central deflection   w   0   / t for the clamped circular Al\u2013ZrO2 plates obtained by the present method and FEM (ANSYS) for particular cases of n=0.5 and n=2. As expected, a good agreement between two solutions is obtained.  In this section, the geometrically nonlinear behaviors of the thin and moderately thick FGPs are investigated using the present S-FSDT-based IGA method. The effects of the boundary condition, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the mechanical responses of the FGPs are explored. All the numerical results are obtained using the cubic order NURBS basis functions, and a 4\u00d74 Gauss quadrature scheme is used in each NURBS element. In the following examples, the boundaries of the plate are denoted as simply supported (S), clamped (C), and free (F); the computational meshes of the square plate and the circular plate are the same as that shown in Figs. 1 and 4, respectively.  A square plate made of Ti\u20136Al\u20134V/aluminum oxide with length a=0.2m and length-to-thickness ratio a/t=20 under a uniform load   q   0   is taken. First, we study the effect of the gradient index and the boundary conditions on the nonlinear responses of the FGPs. By doing that different values of the gradient index n and four boundary conditions (SSSS, CCCC, CSCS and CFCF) are considered. The normalized center deflection for different gradient indexes and normalized load parameters P =   q   0     a  4  /  (    E   m     t  4   )  are shown in Fig. 8 with four different boundary conditions. From the given results some interesting points may be drawn as follows: (1) a pronounced nonlinear behavior can be observed when the applied transverse load reaches a certain level; (2) for all the considered boundary conditions, the nonlinear responses exhibit similar characteristics. However, in order to obtain a similar amplitude of the deflection, it can be easily observed in Fig. 8 that the applied loading, P , for the clamped boundary must be in about 8\u201310 times that of the other types of boundaries; (3) the responses can be viewed as linear, approximately, once the loadings get very small or large; (4) for different values of the gradient index n, the curves of the normalized center deflection form in a similar shape; and (5) the effect of the gradient index on the nonlinear responses of the FGPs is significant, in other words the central deflection increases with increasing the value of n.  Such influences of the gradient index and the boundary conditions on the axial stresses are also studied. The normalized axial stresses    \u03c3 \u00af    x   = (   \u03c3   x     a  2  /   E   m     t  2  ) through the thickness of the Ti\u20136Al\u20134V/aluminum oxide plate under a uniform transverse load   q   0   =\u22121\u00d7106 N/m2 are also computed, and their numerical results are depicted in Fig. 9 for different boundary conditions. Profiles of the stresses are similar to the simply supported and the clamped boundary conditions, but the magnitudes of the stresses of the clamped plate are less than the corresponding values of the simply supported plate. When n approaches toward to a very small value but not equal to zero, abrupt change of the axial stress near the bottom surface of the FGP (metal-rich) occurs, whereas sudden change of the axial stress near the top surface of the FGP (ceramic-rich) can be also observed when n is being reached a very large value. This may be explained using the volume fraction of the constituents, i.e., when n is very close to zero, the volume fraction of the ceramic near the bottom surface (metal-rich) changes suddenly, and the same phenomenon occurs near the top surface (ceramic-rich) when n is relatively large.  We next explore how the nonlinear responses of the FGPs look like when altering the ratio of the length-to-thickness aspect. The normalized center deflections of the simply supported square Ti\u20136Al\u20134V/aluminum oxide plate with the normalized load parameters P =   q   0     a  4  /  (    E   m     t  4   )  are shown in Fig. 10 for different the length-to-thickness ratios. Four values of the length-to-thickness ratios of a / t =5, 10, 20 and 100 are considered. From Fig. 10, it may be concluded that (1) the behaviors of the normalized center deflections for different ratios reveal a similar situation; (2) The center deflections rapidly decrease as the length-to-thickness ratio varies from 5 to 10; while the variations of the center deflections are small as further increasing the length-to-thickness ratio; (3) as expected, the center deflection of the plate asymptotically approaches to a constant value with increasing the length-to-thickness ratio.  Last example considers a circular Al\u2013ZrO2 FGP with radius R=1m and thickness t=0.1m subjected to a uniform transverse load   q   0   . The material properties of Al and ZrO2 are already given in Section 4.3.    Fig. 11 shows the variations in the normalized central deflection   w   0   / t with respect to the normalized load parameter P =   q   0     R  4  /  (    E   m     t  4   )  for the simply supported and the clamped circular Al\u2013ZrO2 plates. A similar deflection pattern as that for the square plate is observed. Once again, the effect of the gradient index on the mechanical responses of the plates is rather high.    Table 3 presents the normalized center deflections for different R/t ratios and the normalized load parameters. It can be seen in the table that the center deflection of the plate asymptotically approaches to a constant value with increasing the R/t ratio.   CONCLUSIONS   We develop an accurate and efficient geometrically nonlinear formulation using IGA and a simple FSDT for geometrically nonlinear analysis of both thin and moderately thick plates. Both the homogeneous and non-homogeneous functionally graded plates are considered. Compared with the traditional FSDT, the S-FSDT formulation is free of the shear-locking, as well as less one unknown is saved. Higher-order continuity of the IGA method can easily treat the awkward C 1-continuity of the generalized displacements required for the S-FSDT. Geometric nonlinearity is accounted for in von-Karman sense. The displacement fields and geometric description are approximated with the aid of the NURBS basis functions. Numerical results are presented for thin to moderately thick FGPs for different length to thickness ratios, gradient indexes, geometric shapes and boundary conditions. The computed center deflection and the axial stress through the thickness are found to be in a good agreement with the reference results available in the literature. The S-FSDT-based IGA produces stable response in geometrically nonlinear analysis of the advanced functionally graded plates.  The NURBS is a standardized format and widely used in engineering design, there also exist many efficient and numerically stable algorithms to generate NURBS objects, thus it has been the technique adopted in isogeometric methodology. However, due to the tensor structure of NURBS, some shortcomings in the application of NURBS-based IGA have been found, for instance, local refinement is prohibited and a large percentage of NURBS control points are superfluous such as the example of circular around 45\u00b0, \u201345\u00b0, 135\u00b0, \u2212135\u00b0. Fortunately, this difficulty can be avoided by using T-splines [36], an effective way of splines techniques to solve the problem of local refinement, and incorporating it into the present formulation would be an interesting work for our future studies.

REFERENCES", "highlights": "This paper presents a novel approach based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and a simple first-order shear deformation plate theory (S-FSDT) for geometrically nonlinear analysis of homogeneous and non-homogeneous functionally graded plates. Owing to many advantages such as (a) the S-FSDT is free of shear-locking, (b) less one unknown for the S-FSDT as compared with the conventional FSDT, (c) the awkward C 1 continuity required for the generalized displacements is treated straightforwardly because of the nature of the higher-order continuity IGA method, the new formulation is thus effective in modeling the geometrical nonlinearities of plates. The S-FSDT is associated with the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n strain for dealing with small strain and moderate rotation. Numerical validation is analyzed and numerical applications are considered. The obtained results are compared with reference solutions to show the accuracy and the effectiveness of the present approach. The effects of different boundary conditions, gradient index, length-to-thickness ratio, geometric shape, etc. on the geometrically nonlinear mechanical responses of functionally graded plates are investigated."}
