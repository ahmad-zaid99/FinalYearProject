Two noded C1 type 4 degree of freedom Timoshenko beam for dynamic analysis of laminated composite beam is implemented.      Numerical results of the partial delamination models proposed are validated with the 3 dimensional COMSOL finite element simulation.          KEYPHRASES   Delamination  Composites  Vibration  Beam element  Timoshenko beam   Fiber-reinforced composite laminates are extensively used in aircraft, helicopters, wind turbine blades and in other industries. Composite laminates are prone to defects such as matrix cracking, strength and stiffness degradation due to aging or corrosion, and delamination between the plies [1\u20136]. Delamination in the composite structure may occur either during the manufacturing process or during the service period of the structure. Delamination may not be visible or be barely visible to external inspection as delamination is embedded within the composite structures. However, delamination reduces the stiffness of the structure and hence it affects the load carrying ability and natural frequencies of the structure.  Vibration characteristics of delaminated composite beams have been studied extensively by many researchers. Delamination models used by these researchers can be broadly categorized into (a) the region approach, (b) the layer-wise approach [2] and (c) variational asymptotic based model [7]. Since the delamination model we are proposing and its implementation is in the purview of region approach, we will concentrate on the region approach in this paper. In the region approach of delamination modeling, the beam is divided into 2 or 3 span-wise regions. If the delamination lies at the root or tip of the beam, then the beam is divided into 2 span-wise regions, comprising healthy and delaminated segments. If the delamination is in the middle section of the beam, then the beam is divided into 3 span-wise regions: two healthy segments at the ends of the beam and one delaminated beam segment in the middle. The approach used to model the delaminated segment is to consider two separate beams above and below the delamination layer along with proper interface conditions at the healthy and delaminated beam segment interface. Further, region based delaminated beam modeling can be divided into free mode delamination modeling and constrained mode delamination modeling. The free mode delamination model shows physically inadmissible mode shapes, in the case of off-mid-plane delamination. The constrained mode model was developed by Mujumdar and Suryanarayan [8], to avoid this kind of incompatibility. However, the constrained mode model could not predict the opening in the mode shapes, as found experimentally by Shen and Grady [9] and Lestari and Hanagud [10]. To address this issue, Luo and Hanagud [11] used an analytical model based on Timoshenko beam theory (TBT) and piece-wise linear springs to simulate the open and closed behavior of delaminated layers.  The finite element model for composite beams using the classical laminate plate theory (CLPT) and delamination using free mode assumption was developed by Babu and Hanagud [12]. Chakraborty et al. [13] developed a 3 noded finite element model, with 3 degrees of freedom per node, for asymmetric composite beams using first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and free mode delamination model assumption. Perel and Palazotto [14] used step functions to model the delamination in composite beams. The finite element model for multiple delamination in composite beams is discussed by Shu and Della [15] and Ju et al. [16]. Ju et al. [16] elaborated about inclusion of bending-extension coupling. Delamination modeling in composite beams using layerwise theory is employed by Saravanos and Hopkins [17] and Lee [18]. The finite element model using first-order zig-zag theory for delaminated-composite beams was developed by Averill [19], and was extended by Kim et al. [20] to include multiple delaminations. Higher-order zig-zag theory for multiple delaminations in a composite beam was developed by Cho and Kim [21]. A detailed review about delamination modeling in beams and plates is provided by Della and Shu [2].  In spite of many delamination models and finite element models mentioned in the literature, the existing literature falls short on two accounts. Firstly, the existing models can only model through-width delamination; however, edge delamination in rotorcraft and wind turbine blades is also a major concern. The other lacuna in existing literature is that researchers primarily use the   C   0   element for Timoshenko beam modeling, mainly to avoid the shear locking effect. C 0 elements are not a good candidate to use, if our intention is to detect delamination using mode shape curvature based algorithms [22]. Though the present paper does not dwell upon the delamination detection, the main motivation for the work is from the damage detection perspective and the present concept of delamination modeling for full width delamination without considering the bending extension coupling was implemented and presented by the same authors at ARF conference [1]. Apart from using C 0 element to mitigate the problem of shear locking in the Timoshenko beam element, there are two other methods to avoid shear locking as mentioned by Reddy [23]. Lin and Zhang [24] used Timoshenko functions for C 1 type element to avoid shear locking. They have compared the results for the static case. However, they did not consider delamination.  The aim of the present paper is to incorporate finiteness of delamination in lengthwise as well as widthwise direction. The partial delamination in the widthwise direction of a beam has not been addressed by the earlier researchers using beam models. The present model also incorporates the effect of partial delamination on the torsional frequency of the composite beam. The Timoshenko beam finite element model of 2 noded, 4 degrees of freedom per node, C 1 type element is used to implement the present delamination model in composite beams. The shear locking in the element is avoided by using the Timoshenko function [24].  The composite beam and the co-ordinate system considered are shown in Fig. 1 . In the figure, L represents the length of the beam, B is the width of the beam, and 2h is the thickness of the beam. The delamination is located at a distance of X  d in the lengthwise direction (X direction) of the beam, and the length of the delamination is l  d . In the widthwise direction of the beam cross section, that is in the Y direction, a delamination length of 2   b   2   to the left of the beam cross section (negative Y direction) and a delamination length of 2   b   4   to the right of the beam cross section (positive Y direction) are considered as shown in Fig. 2 . The delamination on the left of the beam cross section starts at \u2212   Y   l   d   and ends at \u2212   Y   l   h   , and the delamination on the right of the beam cross section starts at Y  r   d and exists up to the tip of the beam cross section. In the thickness direction of the beam cross section, delamination is at a distance of Z  l   d from the midplane on the left side, and on the right side of the beam the delamination is located at Z = \u2212   Z   r   d   . The delaminated beam cross section is partitioned into sub-sections 1\u20136, indicated by corresponding encircled numbers in Fig. 2, for the ease of energy calculation. The local coordinate system for the sections is shown in Fig. 2.  The following assumptions are made for the displacement-based formulation of the beam:  1. The plane section normal to the center line of the beam remains plane after deformation [23].  Through-the-thickness deformation and stresses are negligible [25].  Beam bending is predominant in the X \u2013 Z plane.  The warping in cross section of the beam is ignored.  Adopting the displacement field assumed in [26] and accounting for the displacement of material points of the cross-section due to torsion as well, the following expressions are obtained:  (1)  u ( X , Y , Z , t ) =   u   0   ( X , t ) + Z \u03b8 ( X , t )      (2)  v ( X , Y , Z , t ) = \u2212 Z \u03c8 ( X , t )      (3)  w ( X , Y , Z , t ) =   w   0   ( X , t ) + Y \u03c8 ( X , t )   Here   w   0   is the transverse displacement of material points in the mid-plane, u 0 is the axial displacement of material points in the mid-plane, \u03b8 is the rotation of the cross-section about the Y-axis, and \u03c8 is the rotation of cross-section about the X-axis. Independent spatial variables are X, Y, and Z, and t is the temporal variable.  Partially delaminated beam cross-section considered is shown in Fig. 2. The delaminated beam cross-section is partitioned into 6 regions as depicted in Fig. 2. This particular configuration of delamination and partitioning of the cross-section of the beam is ideal to simulate most of the delamination cases arising in beam-like structures, through straightforward specialization and/or extrapolation of the analytical model being developed herein.  Consider the interface of the healthy beam segment and the delaminated beam segment in the longitudinal direction. The following conditions have to be met:  1. Generalized displacement continuity: displacement function w ( X , t ) and rotation \u03b8 ( X , t ) will have to remain continuous, as w or \u03b8 can only be discontinuous when there is a cut or kink, respectively, at the section and the two sections slide in the Y \u2013 Z plane.  Displacement u ( X , Z , t ) will be continuous at the interface.  Vectorial sum of the generalized forces should be zero, to satisfy equilibrium at the interface.  The displacement function for u of the delaminated cross-sections in the region   x   d   < X <   x   d   +   l   d   of the beam is piecewise continuous, and is given by  (4)  u ( X , Z , t ) = {       u   0   ( X , Z , t ) + Z \u03b8   {     \u2200 \u2212 h \u2264 Z \u2264 h   and \u2212   Y   l   d   \u2264 Y \u2264   Y   r   d       \u2200 \u2212 h \u2264 Z \u2264 h   and \u2212 b \u2264 Y \u2264 \u2212   Y   l   h             u   0   +   Z   l   a   \u03b8 [   m   df   \u03c6 (   Y   2   ) ] +   Z   2   \u03b8   \u2200 \u2212   h   2   \u2264   Z   2   \u2264   h   2    and \u2212   b   2   \u2264   Y   2   \u2264   b   2         u   0   \u2212   Z   l   b   \u03b8 [   m   df   \u03c6 (   Y   3   ) ] +   Z   3   \u03b8   \u2200 \u2212   h   3   \u2264   Z   3   \u2264   h   3    and \u2212   b   2   \u2264   Y   3   \u2264   b   2         u   0   +   Z   r   a   \u03b8 [   m   df   \u03c6 (   Y   4   ) ] +   Z   4   \u03b8   \u2200 \u2212   h   4   \u2264   Z   4   \u2264   h   4    and \u2212   b   4   \u2264   Y   4   \u2264   b   4         u   0   \u2212   Z   r   b   \u03b8 [   m   df   \u03c6 (   Y   5   ) ] +   Z   5   \u03b8   \u2200 \u2212   h   5   \u2264   Z   5   \u2264   h   5    and \u2212   b   4   \u2264   Y   5   \u2264   b   4            The factor   m   df   \u03c6 ( Y ) is a function, which specifies the amplification of the displacement in the delaminated region due to the delamination, or equivalently the reduction in stiffness of the delaminated region due to the delamination. The function is arrived based on the following reasoning: consider the case of total delamination in the widthwise direction of the beam. The following points are known/observed, either from the mechanics or from the literature on delamination studies:  1. The reduction in the stiffness of the laminate is a function of delamination length i.e., we see a reduction in the natural frequencies, as the delamination length increases for a given length of beam [2,9].  When we have two beams placed one above another without bonding (total delamination in the widthwise direction as well as lengthwise direction of the beam), the bending stiffness of the combined beam is the sum of the bending-stiffness of the individual beams [25].  The reduction in the bending-stiffness of the laminate is a function of delamination location in the thickness direction of the beam [2,9].  The bending stiffness of the sub-laminate.  The contribution of axial stiffness towards the bending stiffness due to eccentricity of the sub-laminate about the midplane of the beam.  The modification function has two components: one denoted as m  df is a modification factor, and the other \u03c6 ( Y ) , which defines how displacement and hence stress varies at the junction of the delaminated section with the healthy section in the beam cross-section. The modification factor should take value one, i.e.,   m   df   = 1 when the delamination length   l   d   = 0 , resulting in the stiffness of the healthy beam. The modification factor should take the value 0 when the delamination length   l   d   = L , as then the cross-sectional bending stiffness of the beam will be the sum of the bending stiffnesses of the top and bottom sub-beams.  Further, the modification factor term can be split into factors consisting of the ratio of the longitudinal delamination and the ratio of the widthwise delamination. The generic form of the delamination modification factor is  (5)    m   df   = 1 \u2212 f (   l   dr   ) \u204e f (   w   dr   )   where f (   l   dr   ) is a function of longitudinal delamination ratio l  dr , and f (   w   dr   ) is a function of width delamination ratio w  dr . Longitudinal delamination ratio is defined as the ratio of length of delamination to the length of the beam i.e.,   l   dr   =   l   d   / L , and width delamination ratio is defined as the ratio of delamination width to the width of the beam section i.e.,   w   dr   = 2   b   2   / B . There are many functions which suit the criteria for modification factor; few of them are listed below  (6a)    m   df   = 1 \u2212   (   l   dr   )   m   \u204e   ( 1 \u2212   w   dr   )   n   : m , n \u03f5   R   +        (6b)    m   df   = 1 \u2212   sin   2   ( \u03c0   l   dr   / 2 ) \u204e [ 1 \u2212 cos ( \u03c0   w   dr   / 2 ) ]   here m = n = 0 corresponds to the case of bending-extension decoupling between the sub-laminates, i.e., bending stiffness of the delaminated beam cross-section is equivalent to sum of the bending stiffnesses of the individual sub-laminates and the contribution of axial stiffness due to its eccentricity towards bending stiffness being neglected.  The function \u03c6 ( Y ) is to be chosen so that the stresses   \u03c3   x   and   \u03c4   xy   are continuous at the interface of sections 1\u20132, 1\u20133, 1\u20134, 1\u20135, 2\u20136, and 3\u20136. If \u03c6 ( Y ) = 1 at the interface, then this leads to discontinuity of displacement u, and discontinuity of the stresses   \u03c3   x   and   \u03c4   xy   at the interface of sections 1\u20132, 1\u20133, 1\u20134, 1\u20135, 2\u20136, and 3\u20136. Hence the function \u03c6 ( Y ) has to be chosen based on the following requirements:  1.   \u03c6 (   Y   2   ) takes the value 0 at the interface of healthy and delaminated sections. This condition is to satisfy the stress (   \u03c3   x   ) continuity at the interface.    \u03c6 \u2032 (   Y   2   ) takes the value 0 at the interface of healthy and delaminated sections. This condition is to satisfy the stress (   \u03c4   xy   ) continuity at the interface.    \u03c6 (   Y   2   ) = 1 in the delaminated sections, next to the interface of healthy delaminated sections.  Non-zero strains in the beam are obtained from the above displacement field as  (7)    \u03b5   xx   =   \u2202 u   \u2202 X   =   \u2202   u   0     \u2202 X   + Z   \u2202 \u03b8   \u2202 X     \u03b3   xz   =   \u2202 u   \u2202 Z   +   \u2202 w   \u2202 X   =   \u2202 w   \u2202 X   + \u03b8   \u03b3   xy   = \u2212 Z   \u2202 \u03c8   \u2202 X     Midplane strains and curvatures are  (8)    \u03b5   xx   0   =   \u2202   u   0     \u2202 X     \u03ba   x   =   \u2202 \u03b8   \u2202 X     \u03ba   xy   =   \u2202 \u03c8   \u2202 X        From classical laminate plate theory (CLPT), the stresses in the lamina [25] are given by  (9)  {       \u03c3   x         \u03c3   y         \u03c4   xy       } = [         Q   \u00af     11         Q   \u00af     12         Q   \u00af     16           Q   \u00af     12         Q   \u00af     22         Q   \u00af     26           Q   \u00af     16         Q   \u00af     26         Q   \u00af     66       ] {       \u03b5   x         \u03b5   y         \u03b3   xy       }      For bending of beams predominantly in X \u2013 Z plane, resulting from the applied force and moment in X \u2013 Z plane, the normal stress   \u03c3   y   is equal to zero, while the strain   \u03b5   y   in composite beam may not be zero due to the Poisson effect [26].  Thus stresses in a lamina of the beam are  (10)  {       \u03c3   x         \u03c4   xy       } = [         Q   \u02dc     11         Q   \u02dc     16           Q   \u02dc     16         Q   \u02dc     66       ] {       \u03b5   x         \u03b3   xy       }   where     Q   \u02dc     11   =     Q   \u00af     11   \u2212   (     Q   \u00af     12   )   2   /     Q   \u00af     22   ,     Q   \u02dc     16   =     Q   \u00af     16   \u2212 (     Q   \u00af     12   \u204e     Q   \u00af     26   ) /     Q   \u00af     22   and     Q   \u02dc     66   =     Q   \u00af     66   \u2212   (     Q   \u00af     26   )   2   /     Q   \u00af     22   , and     Q   \u00af     ij   \u2019 s are transformed lamina stiffness coefficients [25].  In CLPT, the laminae are assumed to be in state of plane stress and hence the shear stress in X \u2013 Z plane is not considered, but in the case of Timoshenko beam theory, we do have shear stress in thickness direction. Fortunately, for orthotropic laminae, shear-extension coupling coefficients are not present and hence shear stress in the X \u2013 Z plane is given by   \u03c4   xz   =     Q   \u00af     55     \u03b3   xz   .  Torsion induces shear stress   \u03c4   xy   and   \u03c4   yz   in the beam, the expression for shear stresses   \u03c4   xy   and   \u03c4   yz   has to be obtained using membrane analogy, as discussed by Swanson [27]. Contribution of shear stress   \u03c4   yz   towards the torsional rigidity of the beam, for thin-walled beams is negligible and hence can be neglected [27]. The presence of delamination in the beam will shift the shear center of the beam cross-section in the delaminated segment; the shift in the shear center of the delaminated beam segment can be obtained by following the formulation similar to thin-walled beam cross-sections as followed by researchers [28\u201330]. The cross-sectional stiffness terms of the delaminated beam segment corresponding to torsional rigidity can be obtained by the means followed by [29,30].  The strain energy in the beam is given by  (11)  V =   1   2     \u222b   0   L     \u222b   \u2212 B / 2   B / 2     \u222b   \u2212 h   h     { \u03c3 }   T   { \u03b5 }  dZ  dY  dX      (12)  V =   1   2   {    \u222b   0     X   d     {    {   \u03b5   \u00af   }   T   [ D ] {   \u03b5   \u00af   } +   \u222b     X   d     (   X   d   +   l   d   )     {   \u03b5   \u00af   }   T     [ D ]   d   {   \u03b5   \u00af   } +   \u222b   (   X   d   +   l   d   )   L     {   \u03b5   \u00af   }   T   [ D ] {   \u03b5   \u00af   }  }  dX  }   where  (13)  { \u03c3 } = {       \u03c3   x         \u03c4   xy         \u03c4   xz       } ;  { \u03b5 } = {       \u03b5   xx         \u03b3   xy         \u03b3   xz       } ;  {   \u03b5   \u00af   } = {       \u03b5   xx   0         \u03b3   xz         \u03ba   x         \u03ba   xy       }      (14)  [ D ] = [         A   \u00af     11     0       B   \u00af     11         B   \u00af     16       0       A   \u00af     55     0   0         B   \u00af     11     0       D   \u00af     11         D   \u00af     16           B   \u00af     16     0       D   \u00af     16         D   \u00af     66       ] ;    [ D ]   d   = [         A   \u00af     11   d     0       B   \u00af     11   d         B   \u00af     16   d       0       A   \u00af     55   d     0   0         B   \u00af     11   d     0       D   \u00af     11   d         D   \u00af     16   d           B   \u00af     16   d     0       D   \u00af     16   d         D   \u00af     66   d       ]           A   \u00af     11   = B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     11    dZ      A   \u00af     55   =   Bk   s     \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     55    dZ      B   \u00af     11   = B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     11   Z  dZ     B   \u00af     16   = B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     16   Z  dZ      D   \u00af     11   = B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     11     Z   2    dZ      D   \u00af     16   = B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     16     Z   2    dZ     D   \u00af     66   = 4 B   \u222b   \u2212 h   h       Q   \u02dc     66     Z   2    dZ   Here k  s is the shear correction factor. The delaminated cross section stiffness coefficients are given in the Appendix.  Kinetic energy of the laminated composite beam is  (15)  T =   1   2     \u222b   0   L     \u222b   \u2212 h   h     \u03c1   k   [    (    \u2202 u   \u2202 t    )   2   +   (    \u2202 v   \u2202 t    )   2   +   (    \u2202 w   \u2202 t    )   2    ] B  dZ  dX   where   \u03c1   k   is the density of the equivalent homogenized material constituting the kth lamina. The complete representation of kinetic energy is given in the Appendix.  The finite element model for the composite beam consists of two node and four degrees of freedom (DOF) per node element. The DOF at each node are axial displacement u, transverse displacement w, slope \u03b8 , and twist \u03c8 . C 0 shape functions are considered for the axial displacement and the twist, shape functions for transverse displacement and slope are obtained from the Timoshenko functions (C 1 type). C 1 type shape functions for Timoshenko beam element are prone to shear locking phenomenon, but by using Timoshenko functions the phenomenon of shear locking can be avoided [24]. Finite element discretization of the beam is shown in Fig. 3 . K  e mentioned in the figure denotes the healthy composite beam element stiffness matrix, and M  e stands for the mass matrix of the composite beam element. K  d   e denotes the delaminated beam element stiffness matrix. The mass matrix of the delaminated beam is considered to be the same as that of healthy beam, as there will be hardly any loss of material or any significant changes in the cross-section due to delamination.  Shape functions for axial displacements and twist of the composite laminated beam are given by Eq. (16), where x is the local co-ordinate system and l  e is the element length  (16)    N   1   u   = 1 \u2212   x     l   e       N   2   u   =   x     l   e          The shape functions for the transverse displacements based on the Timoshenko displacement functions [24] or equivalently from the interdependent interpolation element of Reddy [23] are  (17)    N   1   b   = 1 +   2   \u03bc   e       l   e   3       x   3   \u2212   3   \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   2   + (      \u03bc   e   \u2212 1     l   e      ) x   N   2   b   =     \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   3   \u2212   ( 3   \u03bc   e   + 1 )   2   l   e       x   2   + (      \u03bc   e   + 1   2    ) x   N   3   b   = \u2212   2   \u03bc   e       l   e   3       x   3   +   3   \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   2   + (    1 \u2212   \u03bc   e       l   e      ) x   N   4   b   =     \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   3   +   ( 1 \u2212 3   \u03bc   e   )   2   l   e       x   2   + (      \u03bc   e   \u2212 1   2    ) x      The shape functions for the rotation based on the Timoshenko displacement functions [24] or equivalently from the interdependent interpolation element of Reddy [23] are  (18)    N   1   s   = \u2212   6   \u03bc   e       l   e   2     (      x   2       l   e     \u2212 x  )   N   2   s   = \u2212 1 \u2212   3   \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   2   +   ( 3   \u03bc   e   + 1 )     l   e     x   N   3   s   =+   6   \u03bc   e       l   e   3       x   2   \u2212   6   \u03bc   e       l   e   2     x   N   4   s   = \u2212   3   \u03bc   e       l   e   2       x   2   \u2212   ( 1 \u2212 3   \u03bc   e   )     l   e     x   here   \u03bc   e   = 1 / ( 1 + 12   \u03bb   e   ) and   \u03bb   e   =     D   \u00af     11   /     A   \u00af     55     L   2   where L is the length of the beam, B is the width of the beam,   l   e   is the element length, h is the semi-thickness of the beam, and x is the element's local coordinate. The advantage of the above interdependent interpolation shape functions is, by considering   \u03bc   e   = 1 and shear correction factor k  s =0, the Timoshenko beam model reduces to the Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam finite element model. This model reduction is somewhat similar and in line with the model reduction as proposed by Kim et al. [31].  The displacements for the composite beam element in the form of nodal displacements are now given by  (19)  {       u   0   ( x )       w   0   ( x )     \u03b8 ( x )     \u03c8 ( x )     } = [       N   1   u     0   0   0     N   2   u     0   0   0     0     N   1   b       N   2   b     0   0     N   3   b       N   4   b     0     0     N   1   s       N   2   s     0   0     N   3   s       N   4   s     0     0   0   0     N   1   u     0   0   0     N   2   u       ] {       u   1         w   1         \u03b8   1         \u03c8   1         u   2         w   2         \u03b8   2         \u03c8   2       }   The above equation can represented in compact form as {   q   \u02dc   } = [ N ] {   q   e   } , where [ N ] is the shape function matrix, and {   q   e   } is the nodal displacement vector.  Element strain and curvature is obtained by substituting Eq. (19) in strain displacement relationship, Eq. (7) and curvature displacement relationship, Eq. (8)   (20)  {   \u03f5   \u02dc   } = {       \u03b5   xx   0         \u03b3   xz         \u03ba   x         \u03ba   xy       } = {       \u2202   u   0     \u2202 x         \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   + \u03b8       \u2202 \u03b8   \u2202 x         \u2202 \u03c8   \u2202 x       } = [       \u2202   N   1   u     \u2202 x     0   0   0     \u2202   N   2   u     \u2202 x     0   0   0     0     \u2202   N   1   b     \u2202 x   +   N   1   s       \u2202   N   2   b     \u2202 x   +   N   2   s     0   0     \u2202   N   3   b     \u2202 x   +   N   3   s       \u2202   N   4   b     \u2202 x   +   N   4   s     0     0     \u2202   N   1   s     \u2202 x       \u2202   N   2   s     \u2202 x     0   0     \u2202   N   3   s     \u2202 x       \u2202   N   4   s     \u2202 x     0     0   0   0     \u2202   N   1   u     \u2202 x     0   0   0     \u2202   N   2   u     \u2202 x       ] {       u   1         w   1         \u03b8   1         \u03c8   1         u   2         w   2         \u03b8   2         \u03c8   2       }   which can be compactly represented as {   \u03f5   \u02dc   } = [ B ] {   q   e   } , where [ B ] is the strain\u2013curvature matrix.  Strain energy of the composite beam element is  (21)    V   e   =   B   2     {   q   e   }   T     \u222b   0     l   e       { B }   T   [   D   \u00af   ] [ B ]  dx {   q   e   }      (22)    V   e   =   1   2     {   q   e   }   T   [   K   e   ] {   q   e   }      Kinetic energy of the composite beam element is  (23)    T   e   =   B   2     {     q   e     \u0307   }   T     \u222b   0     l   e       \u222b   \u2212 h   h     [ N ]   T     \u03c1   k   [ N ]  dx {     q   \u0307     e   }      (24)    T   e   =   1   2     {     q   e     \u0307   }   T   [   M   e   ] {     q   \u0307     e   }   where M  e is the mass matrix of the element. Shear correction factor is only for the stiffness terms. Hence these terms have to be ignored for mass matrix calculations. Therefore,   \u03bc   e   = 1 is used in the shape functions to obtain mass matrix of the elements.  The finite element equations of the system are derived by using Hamilton's principle, which is stated as  (25)    \u222b     t   1       t   2       \u2211   e = 1   N   ( \u03b4   T   e   \u2212 \u03b4   V   e   )  dt = 0   where t 1 and t 2 are the initial and final times, respectively, and the variations of displacements at the initial and final time step are considered to be zero, i.e., \u03b4   u   0   = \u03b4   w   0   = \u03b4 \u03b8 = \u03b4 \u03c8 = 0 at t =   t   1   ,   t   2   , in the equation derivation. \u03b4   T   e   is the variation in the kinetic energy and \u03b4   V   e   is the variation of strain energy of the element.  Finite element equation for the eigenvalue problem is obtained as  (26)  Kq =   \u03c9   2   Mq      There are many methods for solving the above eigenvalue problem [32,33]. The inverse iteration method and generalized Jacobi method are the simplest and widely used for small number of degree of freedom systems [33]. Since our problem is a simple cantilever beam, we have used the above-mentioned methods.  A cantilever beam made of graphite/epoxy composite with stacking sequence   [ 0 / 90 ]   2 s   , 0.127m length, 0.0127m breadth, and 10.16mm thickness is considered for the numerical simulation for the healthy as well as delaminated states of the beam. Each ply has a thickness of 1.27mm. This particular configuration of the beam is used in simulation, as experimental, analytical and numerical results are available in the literature [2,9] for comparison. Results are also validated with 3D finite element simulation using COMSOL 4.2a. The 3D finite element beam model is meshed with 40000 hexahedral elements. Delamination in the 3D beam is simulated using thin elastic layer.  The results for the free mode delamination case neglecting the effect of eccentricity of the sub-beams in the delaminated segment of the beam, as specified by Della and Shu [2], can also be simulated in the present model. Free mode delamination neglecting effect of eccentricity of the sub-beams is simulated in the present model by considering   m   df   = 0 or equivalently considering m=0 and n=0 in Eq. (6a). The natural frequency for the healthy as well as the delaminated states of the beam, for the free mode delamination case, is tabulated in Table 1 . Delamination length of 25.4mm is considered in the simulation. The results from the present model is comparable with the free mode delamination model of Shen and Grady [9]. Chronologically, free mode delamination model neglecting the effect of eccentricity of the sub-beams in the delaminated segment of the beam is one of the earliest delamination models. The results obtained from this free mode delamination model will be substantially lower than the experimental and 3D FEM results. Since in 3D FEM simulation eccentricity of the sub-beams is accounted in the 3D geometric model, 3D FEM cannot simulate free mode delamination.  The results for the case of constrained mode model can be simulated by using different functions for m  df , given by Eqs. (6a) and (6b). The results for different delamination lengths and at different interfaces (refer Fig. 4 ) are tabulated in Tables 2\u20135    . Second column of the tables refer to the experimental work conducted by Shen and Grady [9], third column results are from the analytical model of first order shear deformation theory computed by Shen and Grady [9]. Finite element results of the delaminated beam from FSDT model computed by Hu et al. [22] are listed in column four. COMSOL results for the 3D finite element simulation using 40000 hexahedral element is listed in column five of the tables. The results for the present model using different delamination factor functions are listed in columns six to eight.  First bending mode shape of the cantilever delaminated beam obtained by simulation in COMSOL, for the case of full-width delamination and 76.2mm of delamination length, is shown in Fig. 5 .  The change in the frequency associated with propagation of delamination in the lengthwise direction from the center of the beam is shown in Fig. 6 , the plot corresponds to the delamination of type shown in Fig. 7 (a), the results are obtained from the proposed model.  The results for simply supported boundary conditions and fixed\u2013fixed boundary conditions are tabulated below. The geometric dimensions, layup sequence and the material properties considered for the beam are the same as that of the cantilever beam. Table 6 shows the results for the simply supported beam and Table 7 shows the results of the fixed\u2013fixed beam support condition, subjected to different delamination lengths in the lengthwise direction. Results are only tabulated for delamination at interface 1 and for the case of full width delamination in the widthwise direction.  From the above tabulated results for cantilever, simply supported and fixed\u2013fixed cases we can safely say that (a) for the case of cantilever boundary condition linear form of the modification factor suits better, (b) quadratic form of modification factor is good for simply supported beam boundary conditions and (c) the trigonometric nonlinear form of modification factor is good for fixed\u2013fixed boundary condition of the beam.  Different cases of partial delamination can be simulated using the present model, typical cases considered are shown in Fig. 7. The case of total width delamination, shown in Fig. 7(a), can be simulated by considering   b   2   = b (see Fig. 2) and width of all other sections to be zero. The results for the case of Fig. 7(a) and for different delamination lengths, at different delamination locations in thickness-wise directions are tabulated in Tables 1\u20137 and are compared with the existing model.  Change in the bending and axial stiffness of the laminate with evolution of delamination in widthwise as well as lengthwise direction of the beam can also be evaluated using the present model. Change in the axial stiffness and bending stiffness is shown in Fig. 8 . We see that there is only change in the bending stiffness of the laminate and the axial stiffness of the laminate remains intact. The delamination considered is at interface 1, and the delamination starts at the center and propagates towards the edges.  The first bending mode frequencies of cantilever beam, for channel type delamination or delamination of type shown in Fig. 7(b), is computed and compared with the results of COMSOL. The results for different percentages of widthwise delamination at interface 1, and for different delamination lengths in the lengthwise direction are tabulated in Tables 8\u201310   .  Results for I-type delamination, for different percentages of delaminations in widthwise direction as depicted in Fig. 7(c), are tabulated in Tables 11 and 12 .The delamination is presumed to be symmetrical in the widthwise direction (Tables 11 and 12  ).  Comparing the results with COMSOL simulation, the polynomial nonlinear modification factor seems comparable with COMSOL results.  First torsional mode of the cantilever beam corresponds to the third natural mode of the healthy beam. Changes in the torsional frequency of the delaminated beam corresponding to different delamination percentages in the widthwise direction are tabulated in Tables 13 and 14  . The results tabulated are for the delamination at interface 1 and for delamination length of 76.2mm and 101.6mm in the lengthwise direction. The results in Table 13 corresponds to the channel type delamination and the results for the symmetric I-type of delamination is tabulated in Table 14. The delamination model for torsional frequencies is by considering the thin-walled construction of the delaminated beam, and the reduction in the cross-sectional stiffness comes directly from the membrane analogy method, hence there is a single delaminated model for calculating the torsional frequencies.  The first torsional mode which corresponds to third natural mode for healthy and totally delaminated beam, will shift to second natural mode for few cases of partial delamination in the widthwise direction. In the case of channel type delamination corresponding to Fig. 7(b) second and third natural modes of the beam for partial delamination exhibit bending-torsion coupled mode shape, but in the case of I-type delamination corresponding to Fig. 7(c) there is no coupling between bending and torsion, since the delamination considered in I-type delamination is symmetric about the Z-axis. Mode shape corresponding to 70% delamination in the widthwise direction, and for 76.2mm delamination in the lengthwise direction at the interface 1 for channel type and I-type delaminations obtained from COMSOL is shown in Fig. 9 to demonstrate the coupling of bending-torsion in channel type delamination, and the difference in the mode shapes of channel type and I-type for the same percentage delamination area in the beam.   CONCLUSIONS   A generic model to obtain homogenized cross-sectional stiffness properties of the delaminated laminated is developed. The first bending and first torsional mode frequencies of the beam at different delamination cases are simulated and compared with existing delamination models and experimental results. From the tabulated results of full-width delamination for different types of boundary conditions it is clear that the linear model is suited for cantilever type of boundary condition, polynomial nonlinearity is best suited for simply supported boundary condition and trigonometric nonlinearity is best suited for fixed\u2013fixed type boundary conditions. It is evident from the partial delamination results that the polynomial nonlinearity with m=1, n=2 is a good model to evaluate the reduction in bending stiffness of a cantilever beam due to delamination. Torsional frequencies of 1D model and the 3D COMSOL simulations vary approximately by 5%. The variation in the torsional frequency of 1D model can be attributed to the lower estimation of torsional rigidity, by neglecting the contribution of stress   \u03c4   yz   towards torsional rigidity for thin-walled beams [27]. The assumption of contribution of   \u03c4   yz   stress towards the torsional rigidity is a good approximation, when the width of the beam is substantially large compared to the thickness of the beam, but when the aspect ratio is of the order of 10 then there is going to be under-estimation of the torsional rigidity [34], and hence under-estimation of torsional rigidity will result in lower estimation of the torsional frequencies.  The delamination model is generic, we can tweak the model based on the boundary conditions, and also other factors which affect the natural frequency of the structure if required. The major advantage of the present model is that it can simulate partial delamination in the beam using a beam model, rather than opting for plate like models, which are the limitations of the existing models available in the literature.  The limitations of the present model are  1. The present model does not consider contact forces generated by the interaction of the delaminated surfaces. Such forces are considered in the models developed by the authors Wang and Tong [35] and Oh et al. [36].  The present model cannot show the opening mode shape of a full-width delaminated beam, though it is capable of predicting natural frequencies. The reason being that the present model uses the homogenized properties in the delaminated sections. The main aim of the present model is to handle partial delamination in the widthwise direction.

method. Homogenized cross-sectional stiffness of the delaminated beam is obtained by the proposed analytical technique, including extension-bending, extension-twist and torsion-bending coupling terms, and hence can be used with an existing finite element method. A two noded C1 type Timoshenko beam element with 4 degrees of freedom per node for dynamic analysis of beams is implemented. The results for different delamination scenarios and beams subjected to different boundary conditions are validated with available experimental results in the literature and/or with the 3D finite element simulation using COMSOL. Results of the first torsional mode frequency for the partially delaminated beam are validated with the COMSOL results. The key point of the proposed model is that partial delamination in beams can be analyzed using a beam model, rather than using 3D or plate models."}
