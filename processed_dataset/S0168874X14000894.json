A force-based plate element is used for the elastoplastic analysis of plate using LIM for the first time.      The convergence and accuracy of the PQ2 element using LIM is verified by solving the linear elastic plate bending problems.      The good performance of LIM in elastoplastic problem is verified.          KEYPHRASES   Displacement-based finite element method  Material nonlinear analysis  Error accumulation  Large Increment Method  Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate theory   Over the last few decades, the displacement-based finite element method (FEM) has been proved to be a highly powerful tool for analyzing a wide variety of physical problems in many areas of engineering. In these fields, two distinct finite element methods named the displacement-based FEM and the force-based FEM have been developed for analyzing very complicated nonlinear problems in structural mechanics and solid mechanics. In recent decades, the displacement-based FEM has dominated current practice for the numerical simulations of nonlinear analysis of structures due to its straightforward implementation and easy computer automation. However, many shortcomings of the FEM have been observed in the analysis of the material nonlinear problems and can be summarized as follows: (a) the error accumulation, which mainly comes from the step-by-step solution procedure, (b) huge computing time consumption, which is due to obtain accurate results with many small enough steps and an iterative algorithm to solve the nonlinear system of equations. At each step, the linearized constitutive relation may vary from the previous step, which will lead to a different system stiffness matrix. Consequently, the different system stiffness matrix has to be handled again and again during the step-by-step process, and (c) inaccuracy of stress, the stresses are calculated indirectly using the differentiation from the displacement, which may cause numerical errors in stress predictions. These shortcomings lead to the reconsideration of the force-based approaches for the material nonlinear problems. It is well known that, the main unknowns in the traditional force-based method are the redundant forces. However, this approach is not easy to implement in computer software because there are difficulties in the selection of the statically determinate structures and constructing the self-stress matrix, and an improper selection may lead to the programming difficulty and computational instability. A number of novel schemes have extended the force method for linear and nonlinear problems [1\u20135]. The main purpose of these researchers is to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional force-based method and the displacement-based FEM. By far, many force-based finite element methods still have to linearize the constitutive model and the error accumulation problem is not suppressed in essence.  As a novel iterative displacement-based method, the large time increment method (LATIN) is proposed for the material nonlinear problem by Ladev\u00e8ze [6]. In recent years, the LATIN has been extended to solve many elastoplastic material [7,8], frictional contact [9], nonlinear multiscale [10] and parallel computing problems [11]. In LATIN, the governing equations are divided into two groups: the global equilibrium and compatibility equations, and the local constitutive equations. This method relies on a step-by-step solution process at the system analysis stage and nonlinear iterative procedure at the local stage using different search direction. It should firstly assume the material behavior to form the initial the system stiffness matrix for getting the initial solution, which can lead to error accumulation. The large increment method (LIM), which is first proposed by Zhang and Liu [4] for material nonlinear problem, is a novel iterative force-based FEM. In LIM, all the independent internal element forces are adopted as system unknowns and the basic determinate structure is no needed, so the LIM becomes a systematic method and it is easy to implement in the computer program. Like the LATIN, the governing equations of LIM are also divided into two groups: the global equilibrium and compatibility equations, and the local constitutive equations. In the case of small deformation, the linear equilibrium equations and the compatibility equations are treated in the global stage and are only solved one time, which will lead to less time consumption. The nonlinear constitutive relation is treated in the local element stage separately. By separating the governing equation into two stages, the constitutive model need not be linearized. Hence the step-by-step solution process is replaced by an overall iterative procedure, and the error accumulation can be avoided. In other words, the loading process often can be handled in one large increment for monotonic loading or a few large increments for cyclic loading. In recent years, LIM has been extended for solving elastic-perfectly plastic analysis of plane frame structures under monotonic and cyclic loading and 2D continuum elastoplastic problems [12\u201314]. The accuracy and efficiency of LIM have been proved. For the parallel computing in the time and spatial domain of LIM, it has great potential for solving large scale structural problems with significant computational saving [15].  In this paper, LIM is employed to analyze the elastic and elastoplastic plate problems using a force-based 4-node quadrilateral plate element (PQ2) [16]. Meanwhile, the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of plate element is derived and implemented to solve elastoplastic plate problems. The PQ2 element has no extra spurious energy modes and can avoid shear locking for solving the thin plate. Two linear elastic plate bending problems are presented to further illustrate the mesh convergence and accuracy of the PQ2 element. Two simple elastoplastic plate problems are presented to study the accuracy and the computational efficiency of LIM by comparing with the results from the FEM software ABAQUS. All the numerical results show that the performance of the LIM is as good as the commercial FEM software in linear elastic and elastoplastic problems.  The outline of the paper is as follows: In Section 2, the basic equations of LIM for plate element is presented. The consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix is given in Section 3. In Section 4 we present the basic theory of LIM. Numerical examples are provided in Section 5 and some conclusions are stated in Section 6.  Only small deformation and small displacement are considered in this paper.  In LIM, the physical domain of the structure is \u03a9 with boundary S . The boundary is divided into two parts: the traction boundary   S   \u03c3   and the displacement boundary   S   u   , where   S   \u03c3   \u2229   S   u   = 0 . The stress resultant M and displacement u at each point in any element can be given by the element generalized force variables and element nodal displacement variable, respectively. The stress resultant fields of the plate element are written as  (1)  M = Z   F  e    where M is the stress resultant vector of plate element, Z is the shape function of generalized force parameter vector, and   F  e  denotes the elemental generalized force parameters vector.  The displacement fields in element are described by  (2)  u = N   d  e    and the strain vector in element is given by  (3)   \u03b5 ^  = Lu =  LN    d  e  = B   d  e    where u is the displacement vector, N is the shape function of the node displacement vector,   d  e  denotes the nodal displacement vector of an element,  \u03b5 ^  is the strain vector, and L is the differential operator.  Using the principle of virtual work, one finds  (4)   \u222b    \u03a9  e     M \u22c5 \u03b4  \u03b5 ^  d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u03a9  e     b \u22c5 \u03b4 u d \u03a9  +  \u222b    S   \u03c3   e      t \u22c5 \u03b4 u d S    where \u03b4  \u03b5 ^  , b , \u03b4 u , t and   S   \u03c3   e   denote the virtual strain, the body force vector, the virtual displacement, the traction force vector and the traction boundary of the element, respectively.  Substituting the Eqs. (1) and (3) into the Eq. (4), the Eq. (4) can be rewritten as  (5)  \u03b4   d   e T   (  \u222b    \u03a9  e       B  T  Z d \u03a9  )   F  e  = \u03b4   d   e T   (  \u222b    \u03a9  e       N  T  b d \u03a9  +  \u222b    S   \u03c3   e        N  T  t d S  )   and the element equilibrium equations can be expressed as  (6)    C  e    F  e  =   P  e    where  (7)  {        C  e  =  \u222b    \u03a9  e       B  T  Z  d \u03a9         P  e  =  \u222b    \u03a9  e       N  T  b d \u03a9  +  \u222b    S   \u03c3   e        N  T  t d S            In Eq. (7),   C  e  is the element equilibrium matrix,   P  e  is the element equivalent nodal force vector.  The equilibrium equations of the system which are obtained by assembling the element equilibrium equations are given as  (8)  CF = P   where C is an m \u00d7 n equilibrium matrix of the structure, and it is assembled from the element equilibrium matrix. For the statically indeterminate structures, the system equilibrium matrix C is an m \u00d7 n non-square matrix with m < n . F is an n \u00d7 1 generalized inner force vector of the structure, and P is an m \u00d7 1 node load vector.  Similarly, using the principle of complementary virtual work, one finds  (9)   \u222b    \u03a9  e     \u03b4   M  T   (  \u03b5 ^  \u2212 Bd ) d \u03a9 = 0      Substituting Eqs. (1) and (3) into Eq. (9), the assembled compatibility equations of the system can be expressed as  (10)    C  T  D = \u03b4   where D is the nodal displacement vector of the structure and \u03b4 is the generalized deformation vector of the structure.  Then, the element constitutive equation can be written as  (11)    \u03b4  e  =   \u03a6  e  (   F  e  , \u03ba )   where  (12)  {        \u03b4  e  =  \u222b    \u03a9  e       Z  T   \u03b5 ^  d \u03a9          \u03a6  e  (   F  e  , \u03ba ) =  \u222b    \u03a9  e       Z  T  \u03d5 ( M , \u03ba ) Z d \u03a9            In Eq. (12),   \u03b4  e  denotes the element generalized deformation vector,   \u03a6  e  (   F  e  , \u03ba ) is the element flexibility matrix and \u03d5 ( M , \u03ba ) represents the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix, which will be given in Section 3.  The constitutive equation of the whole system can be written as  (13)  \u03b4 = \u03a6 ( F , \u03ba )   where the function matrix \u03a6 ( F , \u03ba ) is defined as  (14)  \u03a6 ( F , \u03ba ) =  [        \u03a6  1  (   F  1  , \u03ba )             \u03a6  2  (   F  2  , \u03ba )          \u2026            \u03a6  n  (   F  n  , \u03ba )      ]       Unlike the traditional FEM, LIM does not have to decompose the spatial domain to obtain substructure and the governing equations are decoupled. For the reason, the constitutive equation can be dealt with on element level. In this case, while solving the constitutive equations, there is no data exchange among all the elements, therefore calculations could be parallelized in spatial domain.  For elastoplastic material undergoing small deformation, the strain can be decomposed into an elastic part    \u03b5 ^   e  and a plastic part    \u03b5 ^   p  , this is  (15)   \u03b5 ^  =    \u03b5 ^   e  +    \u03b5 ^   p       The stress resultant can be written as  (16)  M =   D   e   (  \u03b5 ^  \u2212    \u03b5 ^   p  )   where   D   e   is the elastic stiffness matrix.  For an elastoplastic material plate with mixed hardening, the yield surface is described by a yield function of the form f ( \u039c , \u03b1 , k ) . By the generalized von Mises yield criterion, the yield function is typically stated as  (17)  f ( \u039c , \u03b1 , k ) =  1 2    ( \u039c \u2212 \u03b1 )  T  P ( \u039c \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u2212  1 3    k  2  (    e \u00af   p  )   where M is a current stress resultant vector, \u03b1 is a back stress vector and k is a hardening function of the equivalent plastic curvature    e \u00af   p  . For convenience, we set  (18)  \u03b7 = \u039c \u2212 \u03b1      In Eq. (17), P can be given as  (19)  P =  [       2 3      \u2212  1 3     0   0   0      \u2212  1 3       2 3     0   0   0     0   0     2 3     0   0     0   0   0        h  2    8   k  2       0     0   0   0   0        h  2    8   k  2         ]    where h is the thickness of the plate and the shear correction factor k equals to 5/6.  For simulating the spreading of plasticity through the plate thickness, k (    e \u00af   p  ) is defined as [17]   (20)  k (    e \u00af   p  ) =  (      h  2    \u03c3   s    4   )   [  1 \u2212  1 3  exp  (  \u2212   8    e \u00af   p    3   e   0      )   ]    where   \u03c3   s   is the uniaxial yield stress and   e   0   = 2   \u03c3   s   / E h is the curvature which gives the initial yielding for pure bending.  Further, by making use of the associated flow rule, the rate equation for the plastic strain can be written as  (21)      \u03b5 ^  \u0307   p  =  \u03bb \u0307    \u2202 f   \u2202 \u03b7   =  \u03bb \u0307  P \u03b7   where  \u03bb \u0307  is a Lagrange multiplier, the yield function f and  \u03bb \u0307  satisfy the Kuhn\u2013Tucker condition:  \u03bb \u0307  \u2265 0 , f \u2264 0 ,  \u03bb \u0307  f = 0 . The rate equations of the equivalent plastic curvature and the back stress can be given as  (22)      e \u00af  \u0307   p  =  \u03bb \u0307     2 3    \u03b7  T  P \u03b7        (23)   \u03b1 \u0307  =  2 3  H \u2032  \u03bb \u0307  \u03b7   where H \u2032 is the kinematic hardening modulus.  By using integration and the generalized midpoint rule [18,19], and integrating from t to t + 1 , the midpoint is t + \u03b1 , where \u03b1 \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] , Eqs. (21)\u2013(23) can be written as  (24)     \u03b5 ^    t + 1   p   =    \u03b5 ^    t   p   + \u03bb P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1        (25)     \u03b5 ^    t + 1   =    \u03b5 ^    t + 1   e   +    \u03b5 ^    t + 1   p        (26)     e \u00af    t + 1   p   =    e \u00af    t   p   + \u03bb    2 3    \u03b7   t + a   T   P   \u03b7   t + a          (27)    \u03b1   t + 1   =   \u03b1   t   + \u03bb  2 3  H \u2032   \u03b7   t + a        For convenience, we set  (28)     \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1   =    3 2    \u03b7   t + \u03b1   T   P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1       and Eq. (26) can be rewritten as  (29)     e \u00af    t + 1   p   =    e \u00af    t   p   +  2 3  \u03bb    \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1        At the point t + \u03b1 , one has  (30)    \u039c   t + \u03b1   = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )   \u039c   t   + \u03b1   \u039c   t + 1        (31)    \u03b1   t + \u03b1   = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )   \u03b1   t   + \u03b1   \u03b1   t + 1        (32)     e \u00af    t + \u03b1   p   = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )    e \u00af    t   p   + \u03b1    e \u00af    t + 1   p        (33)     \u03b5 ^    t + \u03b1   p   = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )    \u03b5 ^    t   p   + \u03b1    \u03b5 ^    t + 1   p        (34)    \u03b7   t + \u03b1   =   M   t + \u03b1   \u2212   \u03b1   t + \u03b1        Substituting Eqs. (30) and (31) into Eq. (34),   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   can be expressed as  (35)    \u03b7   t + \u03b1   = (   \u039c   t   \u2212   \u03b1   t   ) + \u03b1 (   \u039c   t + 1   \u2212   \u039c   t   ) \u2212 \u03b1 (   \u03b1   t + 1   \u2212   \u03b1   t   )      By using Eqs. (24) and (25), we have  (36)     \u03b5 ^    t + 1   \u2212    \u03b5 ^    t   =    C \u2322    e   (   M   n + 1   \u2212   M   n   ) + \u03bb P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1     where    C \u2322    e   is the elastic flexibility matrix.  The derivative of Eq. (36) is expressed as  (37)  d    \u03b5 ^    t + 1   =    C \u2322    e   d   M   t + 1   + P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   d \u03bb + \u03bb P d   \u03b7   t + \u03b1     where  (38)  d   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   = \u03b1 d   M   t + 1   \u2212 \u03b1 d   \u03b1   t + 1        By inserting Eq. (27) into Eq. (38), one has  (39)  d   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   =   \u03b1 d   M   t + 1   \u2212 ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032     \u03b7   t + \u03b1   d \u03bb   1 + \u03bb \u03b1 ( 2 / 3 )   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032          Substituting Eq. (39) into Eq. (37), we get  (40)  d    \u03b5 ^    t + 1   =  (     C \u2322    e   +   \u03bb \u03b1 P   1 + ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1 \u03bb   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032      )  d   M   t + 1   +  (    P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1     1 + ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1 \u03bb   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032      )  d \u03bb   When Eq. (32) is substituted into Eq. (29), the derivative of Eq. (29) is written as  (41)  d    e \u00af    t + \u03b1   p   =  2 3  \u03b1    \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1   d \u03bb +   \u03bb \u03b1   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   T   P d   \u03b7   t + \u03b1        \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1          To get d \u03bb , the consistency condition is introduced as  (42)  d   f   t + \u03b1   =   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   T   P d   \u03b7   t + \u03b1   \u2212  2 3    k   t + \u03b1     k   t + \u03b1   \u2032   d    e \u00af    t + \u03b1   p   = 0      Substituting Eqs. (39) and (41) into Eq. (42), we obtain  (43)  d \u03bb =  (    1 \u2212 ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1   k   t + \u03b1   \u2032   \u03bb   ( 4 / 9 )    \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1   2   (   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032   +   k   t + \u03b1   \u2032   )    )    \u03b7   t + \u03b1   T   P d   M   t + \u03b1        By combining Eqs. (40) and (43), the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix can be given as  (44)  \u03d5 =    C \u2322    e   +   \u03bb \u03b1 P   1 + ( 2 / 3 ) \u03bb \u03b1   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032     +   ( 1 \u2212 ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1   k   t + \u03b1   \u2032   \u03bb ) P   \u03b7   t + \u03b1     \u03b7   t + \u03b1   T   P   ( 4 / 9 )    \u03b7 \u00af    t + \u03b1   2   (   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032   +   k   t + \u03b1   \u2032   ) ( 1 + ( 2 / 3 ) \u03b1 \u03bb   H   t + \u03b1   \u2032   )        For the generalized midpoint rule, unconditional stability requires \u03b1 \u2265 1 / 2 . Considering the simplest case, one sets \u03b1 = 1 .  For the indeterminate structures, the equilibrium matrix is non-square matrix in LIM. The generalized inverse matrix theory is employed to obtain the set of solutions of the non-square matrix equations directly. First the initial force is got and the constitutive equations are then utilized to obtain the element deformation. The deformation compatibility is used as the optimization objective, and the problem becomes an optimization problem. For solving the optimization problem, the conjugate gradient method is used to find the correct solution.  For the material nonlinear problems, the current level and the history records of stress and strain are used for the constitutive equations. Therefore, the loading history must be considered. Take some key sample points in the loading history function P ( t ) , t \u2208 [ 0 , T ] and the corresponding key sample points are shown in Fig. 1. The time domain parallel computation can use the pipelined parallel computation.  Step 1: Using the generalized inverse matrix theory to solve the equilibrium equation of the system and find out a special solution   F   0   (   t   j   ) as the initial value of the iteration  (45)    F   0   (   t   j   ) =   C   R   \u2212 1   P (   t   j   )   where j = 1 , 2 , 3 , \u2026 , r .  Step 2: Iterate from   F   n   (   t   j   ) to   F   n + 1   (   t   j   )    Calculate the deformation vector   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) corresponding to   F   n   (   t   j   )    (46)    \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) = \u03a6 (   F   n   (   t   j   ) ,   \u03b5   p n   (   t   j   ) )      Check whether the deformations are sufficiently compatible or not  (47)  \u03b5 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) =   | | \u03b2   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) | |   | |   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) | |     if \u03b5 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) \u2264   e   0   (   e   0   is the given error tolerance), then the deformations are sufficiently compatible, no more iterations are required and go to Step 3. Otherwise, the deformation vector   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) is not compatible enough,   F   n   (   t   j   ) should be modified to improve the compatibility of the deformation vector.  Calculate the search direction   S   n      (48)    S   n   (   t   j   ) = \u2212 \u03b2 K \u2032 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) \u03b2   \u03b4   n     where K \u2032 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) is the current stiffness matrix, which can be obtained by calculating the inverse of the flexibility matrix \u03a6 \u2032 (   F   n   (   t   j   ) ) .  Calculate the search step length  (49)    h   n   (   t   j   ) = \u2212     \u03b4   n   T   (   t   j   )   S   n   (   t   j   )     S   n   T   (   t   j   ) \u03a6 \u2032 (   F   n   (   t   j   ) )   S   n   (   t   j   )            F   n + 1   (   t   j   ) can be calculated as  (50)    F   n + 1   (   t   j   ) =   F   n   (   t   j   ) +   h   n   (   t   j   )   S   n   (   t   j   )      Step 3: Obtain the final results  (51)  F =   F   n   \u03b4 =   C  T    ( C   C  T  )   \u2212 1   C   \u03b4   n   U =   ( C   C  T  )   \u2212 1   C \u03b4      The follow chart gives an overview of the entire solution procedure in Fig. 2.  The convergence and the shear locking phenomenon of the PQ2 have been verified by analyzing the clamped moderately thick plate under uniform load [16]. To further illustrate the accuracy and the mesh convergence of the plate element PQ2 for the linear elastic plate problems, two numerical examples are investigated by comparing with the analytical solution as well as the results of the commercial FEM software ABAQUS 6.10 in this section and the existing 4-node quadrilateral displacement-based plate elements, namely the Q4 element [20], the Q4-R element [21] and the RDKQM element [22]. Meanwhile, two simple material nonlinear plate problems are investigated to show the performance of LIM in solving the material nonlinear plate bending problems. The results are compared with the results of the commercial FEM software ABAQUS 6.10.  A square plate with clamped and simply supported boundary conditions subjected to a uniform load is analyzed. The non-dimensional parameters: the side length L=40, the thickness h=0.4 or 8, Young\u05f3s modulus E = 2.1 \u00d7   10   11   , Poisson\u05f3s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and the uniform load q = 1 . Due to symmetries both in the geometry and the loading, a quarter of the plate is analyzed with various mesh sizes. The 4\u00d74 regular meshes for a quarter of the square plate model are shown in Fig. 3. The results of LIM are compared with the analytical solutions [23] and the results of the ABAQUS\u05f3s quadrilateral shell element (S4R element) with through-the-thickness stress integration (with three integration points). The convergence of the plate element is shown in        Figs. 4\u201311.  From the Figs. 4\u201311, it is clear that the mesh convergence of the PQ2 element for solving the linear elastic plate bending problems is as good as the famous reduced integration quadrilateral shell element S4R and the Q4-R plate element. In most cases, the force-based quadrilateral PQ2 element gives more accurate stress resultant results than the S4R element, the Q4 element and RDKQM element with an increase in the number of elements.  A circular plate with simply supported conditions subjected to a uniform load. The non-dimensional parameters: the radius R=5, the thickness h=1 and 2.5 for the moderately thick plate, h=0.1 for the thin plate, Young\u05f3s modulus E=10.92, Poisson\u05f3s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and the uniform load q=1. Due to symmetry of the plate, only a quarter of the plate which is discretized using 12 and 48 elements as shown in Fig. 12 is analyzed. The analytical solutions for the central deflection and the moment are obtained by Ayad and Rigolot [24].  In  Tables 1 and 2, the PQ2 element show weakly sensitive for the thin plate analysis. Meanwhile, the numerical results can converge to the analytical solution with an increase in the number of elements. The S4R element has six degrees of freedom for each node. Therefore, the PQ2 element has lower computation consumption than the S4R element. The force-based quadrilateral PQ2 element gives more accurate stress resultant and deflection results than the Q4 element with an increase in the number of elements.  In order to illustrate the performance of LIM for solving the material nonlinear plate problem with monotonic loading, a clamped square plate of bilinear hardening material under uniform load is analyzed. The non-dimensional parameters: the plate side length L=40, the thickness h=8, Young\u05f3s modulus E = 2.1 \u00d7   10   11   , the tangent modulus   E   t   = 2.1 \u00d7   10   10   , Poisson\u05f3s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and the yield stress   \u03c3   y   = 2.1 \u00d7   10  7  . The kinematic hardening rule is assumed. Numerical analysis performed with regular meshes of 8\u00d78 elements. The loading path and the constitutive relation are presented in  Figs. 13 and 14, respectively.  The results are compared with those obtained by ABAQUS\u05f3s quadrilateral shell element (S4R element) with through-the-thickness stress integration (with three integration points) and von Mises yield criterion. The load-deflection curve is presented in Fig. 15.   Fig. 15 shows that the results obtained by LIM are as accurate as the one obtained by the displacement-based FEM for the moderately thick plate problem. Notice that, it takes at least 20 increments (10 increments for each loading step) and 24 iterations for ABAQUS to obtain the curve shown in Fig. 15, with the criterion for residual force set to be 5.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3   and the criterion for displacement correction set to be 1.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 2   . However, LIM iterates 11 times to find the optimum solution which ensure that the relative error for deformations \u03b5 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) \u2264 1.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 6   .  The S4R element has more degrees of freedom than the PQ2 element, so the PQ2 element has lower computation consumption than the S4R element. Clearly speaking, ABAQUS has to construct governing equations for the whole system and solve them for 24 times. However, LIM just need to repeat the optimization part which is shown as Step 2 in Fig. 2 for 11 times. It clearly proves the efficiency of LIM in dealing with the elastoplastic problem. For the monotonic loading case, LIM can reach a solution in one large increment or in a few large steps, and can also eliminate the cumulative errors. Meanwhile, the calculation in the loading steps can be implemented simultaneously because of its independence on other each step.  In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of LIM in the elastoplastic plate problem with cyclic loading, a clamped square plate of bilinear hardening material under uniform loading is analyzed. The non-dimensional parameters: the plate side length L=40, the thickness h=0.4, Young\u05f3s modulus E = 2.1 \u00d7   10   11   , the tangent modulus   E   t   = 2.1 \u00d7   10   10   , Poisson\u05f3s ratio \u03bd = 0.3 and the yield stress   \u03c3   y   = 2.1 \u00d7   10  5  . The kinematic hardening rule is assumed. Numerical analysis performed with regular meshes of 8\u00d78 elements. The loading path and the constitutive relation are presented in  Figs. 16 and 17, respectively.  The results are compared with those obtained by ABAQUS\u05f3s quadrilateral shell element (S4R element) with through-the-thickness stress integration (with three integration points) and von Mises yield criterion. The load-deflection curve is presented in Fig. 18.  In Fig. 18, it shows that the results obtained by LIM are as accurate as the one obtained by the displacement-based FEM for the thin plate problem. Notice that, it takes at least 30 increments (10 increments for each loading step) and 43 iterations for ABAQUS to obtain the curve shown in Fig. 18, with the criterion for residual force set to be 5.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 3   and the criterion for displacement correction set to be 1.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 2   . However, LIM iterates 13 times to find the optimum solution which ensure that the relative error for deformations \u03b5 (   \u03b4   n   (   t   j   ) ) \u2264 1.0 \u00d7   10   \u2212 6   .  As we known, the S4R element has more degrees of freedom than the PQ2 element, so the S4R element has more computation consumption than the PQ2 element. It is clear that ABAQUS has to construct governing equations for the whole system and solve them for 43 times. However, LIM just need to repeat the optimization part which is shown as Step 2 in Fig. 2 for 13 times. It clearly proves the efficiency of LIM in dealing with the elastoplastic problem. For the cyclic loading case, LIM can reach the solution in a few large steps, and also can eliminate the cumulative errors. Meanwhile, the calculation in the loading steps can be implemented using pipelined parallel computation.   CONCLUSIONS   This paper presents an extension of LIM for solving the elastic and elastoplastic plate problems and the consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of the plate element is derived. The convergence and accuracy of the PQ2 element are also illustrated by the numerical examples of the linear elastic plate problems. The accuracy and efficiency of LIM to solve material nonlinear problems are shown by the monotonic and cyclic loading analysis cases. The numerical results show a very good comparison with the FEM results and LIM can serve as an alternative method to displacement-based FEM.  For the material nonlinear problems, the parallel computation in LIM could be executed both in spatial domain and time domain in theory. The LIM has great potential for solving the material nonlinear problems with significant computational savings by using parallel computation. This will be a valuable topic as a separate work in the future research.

REFERENCES", "highlights": "The displacement-based finite element method (FEM) has become a method of choice for material nonlinear analysis of plates. For material nonlinear problems, the displacement-based FEM relies upon a step-by-step incremental approach and the repetitive computation of the systematic stiffness matrix. These shortcomings lead to the error accumulation and huge computational consumption, which encourage the reconsideration of force-based methods for elastoplastic problems. In this paper, a force-based Large Increment Method (LIM) is employed for the elastoplastic analysis of plates using a force-based 4-node quadrilateral plate element which is based on Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate theory. The consistent elastoplastic flexibility matrix of plate element is derived and implemented to solve elastoplastic plate problems. Two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the mesh convergence of the plate element by solving the linear elastic thin and moderately thick plate problems by comparing with the analytical solutions and displacement-based plate elements. Two simple elastoplastic plate problems are presented to illustrate the accuracy and the computational efficiency of LIM by comparing with the results from the FEM software ABAQUS."}
