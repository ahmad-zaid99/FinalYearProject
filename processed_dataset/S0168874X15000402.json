A new fuzzy finite element method is proposed.      The proposed method can reduce computational cost.          KEYPHRASES   Fuzzy  Variational principle  Finite element method  Modal analysis  Eigenvalue  Eigenvector  Perturbation   The modal analysis of structures plays an important role in the design and analysis of structural systems. However, real engineering structures are usually complicated systems, which possess various uncertainties due to the manufacture errors, measurement errors and other factors. Consequently, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of structural systems are also uncertain.  The modal analysis of structures with uncertain parameters has been the subject of some scientists and engineers for many years. Deif [1] proposed a method to obtain interval eigenvalues for the standard interval eigenvalue problem. Considering the characteristics of structural systems through the non-negative decomposition of the mass and stiffness matrices, Qiu et al. [2] presented an approach for solving the generalized interval eigenvalue problem. Sim et al. [3] developed a modal analysis method to estimate modal parameters, frequency response function and mode shapes of structures with uncertain-but-bounded parameters via interval analysis. Zhu and Wu [4] proposed a stochastic finite element method for both distinct and repeated eigenvalues and derived formulae for the variance and covariance of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Based on the perturbation approach, Song et al. [5] applied a method to obtain the stochastic sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which does not greatly increase the computational cost compared to deterministic analysis. Chen and Rao [6] developed a methodology using the fuzzy finite element method for eigenvalues and eigenvectors of imprecisely defined systems. Based on \u03b1-cut discretization of fuzzy numbers and Taylor\u05f3s expansion, Massa et al. [7] presented an efficient methodology to calculate fuzzy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of finite element structures defined by fuzzy parameters. As we can see above, there are several methods to deal with uncertain analysis of structures: the interval-based methods; the stochastic-based methods; and the fuzzy-based methods, etc. When the system parameters are described in linguistic or imprecise terms, the fuzzy-based methods are appropriate [8].  Among numerical methods for the fuzzy analysis of structural systems, the fuzzy finite element method is a widely used method. Based on the theory of fuzzy sets, Valliappan and Pham [9] proposed a finite element model to take account of the uncertainty in the soil behavior and considered the elastic modulus and Poisson\u05f3s ratio as fuzzy numbers. Rao and Sawyer [8] developed a fuzzy finite element approach for the static analysis of structural systems with parameters described in linguistic or imprecise terms, this method can be applied to analyze problems involving vaguely defined geometry, material properties, external loads and boundary conditions. Wasfy and Noor [10] presented a fuzzy finite element method for predicting the dynamic response and evaluating the sensitivity coefficients of flexible multibody systems with fuzzy parameters. By using the interval finite element method, Moens and Vandepitte [11] and Gersem et al. [12] introduced a numerical algorithm to calculate frequency-response functions of damped finite element models with fuzzy uncertain parameters. Based on a sensitivity analysis and a high order Taylor series expansion, Massa et al. [13] proposed a fuzzy procedure for the static design of imprecise structures. This methodology can deal with structures modeled by imprecise material or geometric parameters and subjected to imprecise boundary conditions and imprecise external loads. Verhaeghe et al. [14] discussed the application of the concept of interval fields and developed a fuzzy finite element analysis technique for structural static analysis based on interval fields to cope with the problem that mutual dependency between multiple uncertain model parameters can\u05f3t be included in the analysis. Farkas et al. [15] applied a reanalysis-based finite element method for static structural analysis and this approach is explicitly suited for optimisation-based black-box techniques. Nearly all these fuzzy finite element methods are based on the interval calculation. When these fuzzy finite element methods are used for the fuzzy analysis, the fuzzy parameters have to be transformed into interval parameters through the concept of \u03b1-level to calculate the interval results at each \u03b1-level of interest. The fuzzy results are subsequently constructed by all the obtained interval results. So the computational cost of these methods is expensive.  The variational principle is one of the important theoretical bases of the finite element method [16]. Many scientists studied the deterministic variational principle and there are a lot of research works on deterministic variational principles [16\u201318]. In the field of uncertain variational principle, scientists focused their attentions on stochastic variational principle. By combining the Hu\u2212Washizu variational principle with second-order perturbation techniques, Liu et al. [19] established a probabilistic Hu\u2212Washizu variational principle for the probabilistic finite element method. Hien and Kleiber [20] formulated a stochastic Hamilton variational principle for dynamic problems of linear continuum. The stochastic Hamilton variational principle allows incorporation of probabilistic distributions into the finite element analysis. Elishakoff et al. [21] proposed a stochastic variational principle for the mean and covariance functions of the displacement of stochastic beams and based on the stochastic variational principle, Galerkin and Rayleigh\u2212Ritz methods were presented to find probabilistic characteristics of the response. Impollonia and Elishakoff [22] extended the stochastic variational principle to the probabilistic response of shear beams with stochastic flexibility, and subjected to deterministic static loads. Expanding all the random quantities involved in the energy functional through second-order perturbation techniques, Yang et al. [23] presented the stochastic transient variational principle for vibration analysis of linear continuum. Based on the stochastic variational principle and second-order perturbation techniques, Yang et al. [24] developed a stochastic spline Ritz method to analyze the structures consisting of elastic beams and plates by a local average of the homogeneous random field. However, there are no research works on the fuzzy variational principle until Yang et al. [25] proposed the fuzzy variational principle for static analysis of structural systems with fuzzy parameters.  In this paper, based on Rayleigh quotient variation and perturbation techniques, the fuzzy variational principle for modal analysis of structural systems is presented. The fuzzy finite element method is developed as the application of the fuzzy variational principle. The proposed fuzzy finite element method can obtain the fuzzy result directly. Compared with the conventional fuzzy finite element methods, the proposed method can reduce the computational cost. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the practicability of the proposed method.  For the sake of simplicity, in this section, indicial notation is employed with indices repeated twice implying summation.  The Rayleigh quotient variation is one of the important theoretical bases of the finite element method for modal analysis of structural systems. Its general form can be described by  (1)    \u03c9  2  = s t     V   max    T  ,   where \u03c9 is the natural frequency, V max is the maximum of the potential energy of elastic, T is the kinetic energy coefficient, and st denotes the operation to find the stationary value of a functional.  If there are fuzzy factors in structural systems, the expression of the Rayleigh quotient variation will be a fuzzy functional, which can be written as  (2)     \u03c9 \u02dc   2  = s t      V \u02dc    max     T \u02dc   ,   where  \u03c9 \u02dc  is the fuzzy natural frequency,    V \u02dc    max   is the fuzzy maximum of the potential energy of elastic,  T \u02dc  is the fuzzy kinetic energy coefficient.       V \u02dc    max   can be expressed as  (3)     V \u02dc    max   =  1 2   \u222b V      D \u02dc    i j k l      \u03b5 \u02dc    i j      \u03b5 \u02dc    k l    d V ,   where    D \u02dc    i j k l   is the fuzzy tensor of elastic moduli,    \u03b5 \u02dc    i j   is the fuzzy strain tensor.     T \u02dc  can be expressed as  (4)   T \u02dc  =  1 2   \u222b V    \u03c1 \u02dc     u \u02dc    i      u \u02dc    i    d V ,   where  \u03c1 \u02dc  is the fuzzy density,    u \u02dc    i   is the fuzzy displacement vector.  The constitutive relation is  (5)     \u03c3 \u02dc    i j   =    D \u02dc    i j k l      \u03b5 \u02dc    k l   ,   where    \u03c3 \u02dc    i j   is the fuzzy stress tensor.  For the sake of simplicity, we can build the following equations  (6)   U \u02dc  =  1 2     D \u02dc    i j k l      \u03b5 \u02dc    i j      \u03b5 \u02dc    k l   ,   and  (7)   M \u02dc  =  1 2   \u03c1 \u02dc     u \u02dc    i      u \u02dc    i   .      Then Eq. (2) can be written as  (8)  \u03b4  \u222b V   U \u02dc  d V =  \u03bb \u02dc  \u03b4  \u222b V   M \u02dc  d V ,   where    \u03bb \u02dc  =    \u03c9 \u02dc   2  is the fuzzy eigenvalue.  All the fuzzy variables of structural systems including geometric parameters, physical parameters, external forces, and boundary conditions, etc., can be denoted with the fuzzy vector field  (9)   X \u02dc  =   {     X \u02dc    1   ,    X \u02dc    2   , \u22ef ,    X \u02dc    r    }  T  ,   where r is the number of fuzzy parameters. The fuzzy field  X \u02dc  can be decomposed as follows  (10)   X \u02dc  =   X   0   +  \u03b2 \u02dc  ,   where  (11)    X   0   =   {    X   01   ,   X   02   , \u22ef ,   X   0 r    }  T  ,   \u03b2 \u02dc  =   {     \u03b2 \u02dc    1   ,    \u03b2 \u02dc    2   , \u22ef ,    \u03b2 \u02dc    r    }  T  ,          X   0 m    (  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r  )  is the real value of    X \u02dc    m    (  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r  )  , and    \u03b2 \u02dc    m    (  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r  )  is the fuzzy perturbation quantity with zero real value.     \u03bb \u02dc  is dependent on the fuzzy vector field  X \u02dc  , so we can expand  \u03bb \u02dc  about the real value X  0 of the fuzzy field  X \u02dc  via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only  (12)   \u03bb \u02dc  =   \u03bb   0   +    \u03b2 \u02dc    m     \u03bb   , m   ,   where \u03bb 0 denotes \u03bb evaluated at the real value of the fuzzy field, \u03bb ,m denotes the first-order partial derivative of \u03bb to the field variable X  m at the real point X  0 in the fuzzy vector field. Similar expansions can be made for other fuzzy quantities    u \u02dc    i   ,    \u03b5 \u02dc    i j   ,  U \u02dc  and  M \u02dc  , etc.  Substituting the expansions of the fuzzy quantities  U \u02dc  ,    c \u02dc    i j k l   and    \u03b5 \u02dc    i j   into Eq. (6) and taking advantage of perturbation techniques, we can obtain  (13)    U   0   =  1 2    D   0 i j k l     \u03b5   0 i j     \u03b5   0 k l   ,   U   , m   =  1 2    D   i j k l , m     \u03b5   0 i j     \u03b5   0 k l   +   D   0 i j k l     \u03b5   i j , m     \u03b5   0 k l   .      Similarly, Eq. (5) leads to  (14)    \u03c3   0 i j   =   D   0 i j k l     \u03b5   0 k l   ,   \u03c3   i j , m   =   D   i j k l , m     \u03b5   0 k l   +   D   0 i j k l     \u03b5   k l , m   .      Comparing Eqs. (13) and (14), we will have  (15)    \u2202   U   0     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j     =   \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   i j , m     =   \u03c3   0 i j   ,   \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j     =   \u03c3   i j , m   .      Similarly, Eq. (7) leads to  (16)    \u2202   M   0     \u2202   u   0 i     =   \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   i , m     =   \u03c1   0     u   0 i   ,   \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   0 i     =   \u03c1   , m     u   0 i   +   \u03c1   0     u   i , m   .      Substituting the expansions of  \u03bb \u02dc  ,  U \u02dc  and  M \u02dc  into Eq. (8), and employing first-order perturbation techniques, we will obtain  Zeroth-order perturbation terms  (17)  \u03b4  \u222b V     U   0    d V =   \u03bb   0   \u03b4  \u222b V     M   0    d V .      First-order perturbation terms  (18)  \u03b4  \u222b V     U   , m    d V =   \u03bb   , m   \u03b4  \u222b V     M   0    d V +   \u03bb   0   \u03b4  \u222b V     M   , m    d V .      Zeroth-order perturbation terms lead to  (19)   \u222b V     \u2202   U   0     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j     \u03b4   \u03b5   0 i j    d V =   \u03bb   0    \u222b V     \u2202   M   0     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i    d V .      Taking account of Ostrovski\u2212Gauss formula, we can obtain  (20)  \u2212  \u222b V     (    \u2202   U   0     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j      )   , j   \u03b4   u   0 i    d V +  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u2202   U   0     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j       n   j   \u03b4   u   0 i    d V =   \u03bb   0    \u222b V     \u2202   M   0     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i    d V .      Substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (20) yields  (21)   \u222b V    (    \u03c3   0 i j , j   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   0 i    )  \u03b4   u   0 i    d V \u2212  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u03c3   0 i j     n   j   \u03b4   u   0 i    d V = 0 .      Since \u03b4u 0i is arbitrary, we can obtain  (22)  {        \u03c3   0 i j , j   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   0 i   = 0     i n  V ,         \u03c3   0 i j     n   j   = 0     o n    S   \u03c3   .           First-order perturbation terms lead to  (23)   \u222b V   (    \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j     \u03b4   \u03b5   0 i j   +   \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   i j , m     \u03b4   \u03b5   i j , m    )  d V =   \u03bb   , m    \u222b V     \u2202   M   0     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i    d V +   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   (    \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i   +   \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   i , m     \u03b4   u   i , m    )  d V .      Similarly, taking advantage of Ostrovski\u2212Gauss formula, we will have  (24)  \u2212  \u222b V     (    \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j      )   , j    \u03b4   u   0 i   d V +  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   0 i j       n   j   \u03b4   u   0 i    d S \u2212  \u222b V     (    \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   i j , m      )   , j    \u03b4   u   i , m   d V +  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u2202   U   , m     \u2202   \u03b5   i j , m       n   j   \u03b4   u   i , m    d S  =   \u03bb   , m    \u222b V     \u2202   M   0     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i    d V +   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   (    \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   0 i     \u03b4   u   0 i   +   \u2202   M   , m     \u2202   u   i , m     \u03b4   u   i , m    )  d V .      Substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (24) yields  (25)   \u222b V    (    \u03c3   i j , j m   +   \u03bb   , m     \u03c1   0     u   0 i   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   , m     u   0 i   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   i , m    )  \u03b4   u   0 i    d V +  \u222b V    (    \u03c3   0 i j , j   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   0 i    )  \u03b4   u   i , m    d V  \u2212  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u03c3   i j , m     n   j   \u03b4   u   0 i    d V \u2212  \u222b    S   \u03c3        \u03c3   0 i j     n   j   \u03b4   u   i , m    d V = 0 .      Since \u03b4u 0i and \u03b4u  i,m are arbitrary and independent, we can obtain  (26)      {        \u03c3   i j , j m   +   \u03bb   , m     \u03c1   0     u   0 i   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   , m     u   0 i   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   i , m   = 0     in  V ,         \u03c3   i j , m     n   j   = 0     on    S   \u03c3   ,            {        \u03c3   0 i j , j   +   \u03bb   0     \u03c1   0     u   0 i   = 0     in  V ,         \u03c3   0 i j     n   j   = 0     on    S   \u03c3   .               Comparing Eqs. (22) and (26), we can conclude that, for the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, the stationary conditions of first-order perturbation terms include the stationary conditions of zeroth-order perturbation terms. As a result, when the fuzzy variational principle is applied to deal with the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, only first-order perturbation terms are necessary to derive all the required governing equations and boundary conditions.  For the sake of clarity, in this section, matrix notation is adopted instead of tensor notation.       V \u02dc    max   and  T \u02dc  can be written in the form  (27)     V \u02dc    max   =  1 2   \u222b V      \u03b5 \u02dc   T   D \u02dc   \u03b5 \u02dc   d V ,   and  (28)   T \u02dc  =  1 2   \u222b V      u \u02dc   T   \u03c1 \u02dc    u \u02dc  d V .      So the Rayleigh quotient variation can be expressed as  (29)  \u03b4  \u222b V    1 2     \u03b5 \u02dc   T   D \u02dc   \u03b5 \u02dc   d V =  \u03bb \u02dc  \u03b4  \u222b V    1 2     u \u02dc   T   \u03c1 \u02dc    u \u02dc  d V ,      When the finite element method is applied to analyze the structure, the structure should be discretized. Through interpolation of element displacement field, we have  (30)     u \u02dc    e   =  \u2211  i = 1  t     N   i    ( x )     a \u02dc    e i    = N    a \u02dc    e   ,   where  (31)  N =  {    N   1   ,   N   2   , \u2026 ,   N   t    }  ,     a \u02dc    e   =  {     a \u02dc    e 1   ,    a \u02dc    e 2   , \u2026 ,    a \u02dc    e t    }  ,   in which t denotes the node numbers of each element,    a \u02dc    e i   denotes the displacement of the ith node of element e and N is the shape function matrix.       a \u02dc    e   is dependent on the fuzzy vector field  X \u02dc  , which is expressed as Eq. (9), so we can expand    a \u02dc    e   about the real value X  0 of the fuzzy field  X \u02dc  via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only  (32)     a \u02dc    e   =   a   e 0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     a   e , m    ,   where a   e0 denotes a   e evaluated at the real value of the fuzzy field, a   e,m denotes the first-order partial derivative of a   e to the field variable X  m at the real point X  0 in the fuzzy vector field.  Similar expansion can be made for    u \u02dc    e      (33)     u \u02dc    e   =   u   e 0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     u   e , m    .      Substituting Eqs. (32) and (33) into Eq. (30) and comparing the coefficient of  \u03b2 \u02dc  , we will have  (34)  {       u   e 0   = N   a   e 0   ,       u   e , m   = N   a   e , m   ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r .          The strain vector    \u03b5 \u02dc    e   and the displacement vector    a \u02dc    e   satisfy the following relationship  (35)     \u03b5 \u02dc    e   = L    u \u02dc    e   = L N    a \u02dc    e   = B    a \u02dc    e   ,   where L denotes the differential operator and B denotes the strain matrix. Taking advantage of perturbation techniques, Eq. (35) yields  (36)  {       \u03b5   e 0   = B   a   e 0   ,       \u03b5   e , m   = B   a   e , m   ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r .          Consider the conclusion that, when the fuzzy variational principle is applied to deal with the problem of modal analysis of structural systems, only first-order perturbation terms are necessary to derive all the required governing equations and boundary conditions. Substituting the first-order perturbation based expansions of the fuzzy quantities  \u03c1 \u02dc  ,  D \u02dc  ,  u \u02dc   and   \u03b5 \u02dc  into Eq. (29), we can obtain first-order perturbation terms  (37)  \u03b4  \u222b V   (   1 2    a   e 0   T   B   D   , m   B   a   e 0   +   a   e 0   T   B   D   0   B   a   e , m    )  d V =   \u03bb   , m   \u03b4  \u222b V    1 2    a   e 0   T   N   \u03c1   0   N   a   e 0    d V +   \u03bb   0   \u03b4  \u222b V    1 2     a   e 0   T   N   \u03c1   , m   N   a   e 0   d V +   \u03bb   0   \u03b4  \u222b V     a   e 0   T   N   \u03c1   0   N   a   e , m    d V .      The above equation leads to  (38)  \u03b4   a   e 0   T    [   \u222b V   B   D   , m   B  d V   a   e 0   +  \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e , m    ]  + \u03b4   a   e , m   T    \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e 0   =   \u03bb   , m   \u03b4   a   e 0   T    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0   +   \u03bb   0   \u03b4   a   e 0   T    [   \u222b V   N   \u03c1   , m   N  d V   a   e 0   +  \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e , m    ]   +   \u03bb   0   \u03b4   a   e , m   T    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0   .      Eq. (38) can be transformed as  (39)  \u03b4   a   e 0   T    [   \u222b V   B   D   , m   B  d V   a   e 0   +  \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e , m   \u2212   \u03bb   , m    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   , m   N  d V   a   e 0        \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e , m    ]  + \u03b4   a   e , m   T    [   \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0    ]  = 0 .      Since \u03b4   a   e , m   T   and \u03b4   a   e 0   T   are arbitrary and independent, the above equation leads to  (40)   \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0   = 0 ,   and  (41)   \u222b V   B   D   , m   B  d V   a   e 0   +  \u222b V   B   D   0   B  d V   a   e , m   \u2212   \u03bb   , m    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   , m   N  d V   a   e 0    \u2212   \u03bb   0    \u222b V   N   \u03c1   0   N  d V   a   e , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r .      For the sake of simplicity, Eq. (40) can be expressed as  (42)    K   e 0     a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   e 0     a   e 0   = 0 ,   where  (43)    K   e 0   =  \u222b V     B  T    D   0   B  d V ,    M   e 0   =  \u222b V     N  T    \u03c1   0   N  d V .      Eq. (41) can be expressed as  (44)    K   e , m     a   e 0   +   K   e 0     a   e , m   \u2212   \u03bb   , m     M   e 0     a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   e , m     a   e 0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   e 0     a   e , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r ,   where  (45)    K   e , m   =  \u222b V     B  T    D   , m   B  d V ,    M   e , m   =  \u222b V     N  T    \u03c1   , m   N  d V .      Then we build the following equation  (46)    a   e 0   =   J   e     a   0   ,   where a   e0 denotes the real value of displacement vector of element e, a  0 denotes the real value of the displacement vector of the whole structural system, J  e denotes the transmit matrix of element e.  Substituting Eq. (46) into Eq. (42) yields  (47)    K   e 0     J   e     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   e 0     J   e     a   0   = 0 .      Multiplying both sides of Eq. (47) with   J   e   T   yields  (48)    J   e   T     K   e 0     J   e     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     J   e   T     M   e 0     J   e     a   0   = 0 .      Every element has an equilibrium equation which is similar to Eq. (48), putting them together, we will have  (49)    K   0     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   0     a   0   = 0 ,   where  (50)    K   0   =  \u2211  e = 1  N     J   e   T     K   e 0     J   e    ,    M   0   =  \u2211  e = 1  N     J   e   T     M   e 0     J   e    ,   in which N is the number of elements.  Similarly, Eq. (44) can be expressed as  (51)    K   , m     a   0   +   K   0     a   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   , m     M   0     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   , m     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   0     a   , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r ,   where  (52)    K   , m   =  \u2211  e = 1  N     J   e   T     K   e , m     J   e    ,    M   , m   =  \u2211  e = 1  N     J   e   T     M   e , m     J   e    .      The normalizing condition is  (53)     a \u02dc    i   T    M \u02dc     a \u02dc    i   = 1 .      Expanding    a \u02dc    i   and  M \u02dc  about the real value X  0 of the fuzzy field  X \u02dc  via Taylor series, and retaining up to first-order terms only, we will have  (54)     a \u02dc    i   =   a   i 0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     a   i , m    ,   and  (55)   M \u02dc  =   M   0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     M   , m    .      Substituting Eqs. (54) and (55) into Eq. (53), and taking advantage of perturbation techniques, we can obtain  (56)    a   i 0   T     M   0     a   i 0   = 1 ,   and  (57)    a   i , m   T     M   0     a   i 0   +   a   i 0   T     M   , m     a   i 0   +   a   i 0   T     M   0     a   i , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r .      Therefore, equations of the fuzzy finite element method for the modal analysis are a set of deterministic recursive equations as follows  (58)    K   0     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   0     a   0   = 0 ,      (59)    a   i 0   T     M   0     a   i 0   = 1 ,      (60)    K   , m     a   0   +   K   0     a   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   , m     M   0     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   , m     a   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   0     a   , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r ,      (61)    a   i , m   T     M   0     a   i 0   +   a   i 0   T     M   , m     a   i 0   +   a   i 0   T     M   0     a   i , m   = 0 ,  m = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , r .      Eq. (58) leads to  (62)  det  (    K   0   \u2212   \u03bb   0     M   0    )  = 0 .      Solving the above equation, we can obtain the real value of fuzzy eigenvalue \u03bb  i0. We will confine ourselves to the case in which the real values of fuzzy eigenvalues   \u03bb   i 0   , i = 1 , 2 , \u2026 , n are all distinct, where n is the number of eigenvalues. Substituting \u03bb  i0 into Eq. (58) and considering Eq. (59), we will have the real value of the normal eigenvector a   i0. Substituting \u03bb  i0 and a   i0 into Eq. (60) yields  (63)   (    K   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   0    )    a   i , m   +  (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i , m     M   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0   = 0 .      According to the expansion theorem, we can build the following equation  (64)    a   i , m   =  \u2211  j = 1  n     b   i j     a   j 0    .      Substituting Eq. (64) into Eq. (63) yields  (65)   (    K   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   0    )   \u2211  j = 1  n     b   i j     a   j 0    +  (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i , m     M   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0   = 0 .      Multiplying both sides of Eq. (65) with   a   s 0   T   , we have  (66)    a   s 0   T    (    K   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   0    )   \u2211  j = 1  n     b   i j     a   j 0    +   a   s 0   T    (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i , m     M   0   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0   = 0 .      Considering the normalizing condition, we can obtain  (67)    b   i s    (    \u03bb   i 0   \u2212   \u03bb   s 0    )  +   \u03bb   i , m     \u03b4   i s   =   a   s 0   T    (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0   .      When i=s, Eq. (67) leads to  (68)    \u03bb   i , m   =   a   i 0   T    (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0   .      When i\u2260s, Eq. (67) leads to  (69)    b   i s   =  1    \u03bb   i 0   \u2212   \u03bb   s 0       a   s 0   T    (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0    ( s \u2260 i ) .      Multiplying both sides of Eq. (64) with   a   s 0   T     M   0   yields  (70)    a   s 0   T     M   0     a   i , m   =  \u2211  j = 1  n     b   i j     a   s 0   T     M   0     a   j 0    .      When s=i, Eq. (70) leads to  (71)    b   i i   =   a   i 0   T     M   0     a   i , m   .      Taking the transpose of both side of Eq. (71) yields  (72)    b   i i   =   a   i , m   T     M   0     a   i 0   .      Substituting Eqs. (71) and (72) into Eq. (61), we will have  (73)    b   i i   = \u2212  1 2    a   i 0   T     M   , m     a   i 0     ( s = i ) .      Substituting Eqs. (69) and (73) into Eq. (64) yields  (74)    a   i , m   = \u2212  1 2    a   i 0   T     M   , m     a   i 0     a   i 0   +  \u2211  j = 1 , j \u2260 i  n    1    \u03bb   i 0   \u2212   \u03bb   j 0       a   j 0   T    (    K   , m   \u2212   \u03bb   i 0     M   , m    )    a   i 0     a   j 0    .      Expanding    \u03bb \u02dc    i   and    a \u02dc    i   about the real value X  0 of the fuzzy field  X \u02dc  via Taylor series, and retain up to first-order terms only, we will have  (75)     \u03bb \u02dc    i   =   \u03bb   i 0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     \u03bb   i , m    ,   and  (76)     a \u02dc    i   =   a   i 0   +  \u2211  m = 1  r      \u03b2 \u02dc    m     a   i , m    .      Substituting \u03bb  i0, \u03bb  i,m , a   i0 and a   i,m into Eqs. (75) and (76), and following the binary fuzzy arithmetic operations [25], we can obtain the fuzzy eigenvalue    \u03bb \u02dc    i   and the fuzzy eigenvector    a \u02dc    i   of structures with fuzzy parameters.  Three examples will be applied to demonstrate the proposed method in this paper. The first is a simply supported beam, which has the analytical solution for the eigenvalue, so it is convenient for us to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in this example. The second is a five-story frame tower structure. In this example, we will solve the problem by using both the proposed method and the conventional fuzzy finite element method, the comparison will illustrate that the proposed method can reduce computational cost. The last example is a 25-bar space truss, in which the fuzzy parameters are the cross-sectional area of the bars. With these fuzzy parameters, both the stiffness matrix and the mass matrix will be fuzzy simultaneously. This is the case that geometric parameters are fuzzy, which is very common in the practical engineering. Example 1 A simply supported elastic beam with fuzzy parameters.  Consider a simply supported elastic beam with uniform cross sections as shown in Fig. 1. The density  \u03c1 \u02dc  and the Young\u05f3s moduli  E \u02dc  of the beam are considered as fuzzy parameters. According to the opinions of experts, the real values of  \u03c1 \u02dc  and  E \u02dc  are taken as \u03c1 0 and E 0, respectively. The possible low and high values of  \u03c1 \u02dc  and  E \u02dc  are  [    \u03c1   l   ,   \u03c1   h    ]  =  [  0.95   \u03c1   0   , 1.05   \u03c1   0    ]  and  [    E   l   ,   E   h    ]  =  [  0.98   E   0   , 1.02   E   0    ]  , respectively. The moment of inertia and the cross-sectional area of the beam are I and A, respectively. The fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method is plotted in Fig. 2.  To demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method, the fuzzy analytical method is used as a benchmark. Taking the density \u03c1 and the Young\u05f3s moduli E in the analytical solution for the eigenvalue of the supported beam as fuzzy parameters, we can obtain the fuzzy analytical method for this example. The fuzzy ith-order eigenvalue by the fuzzy analytical method is given by  (77)     \u03bb \u02dc    i   =     i  4    \u03c0  4   E \u02dc  I    \u03c1 \u02dc  A   L  4    .        Table 1 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first order eigenvalue by the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method at various \u03b1-levels. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first ten eigenvalues by the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method at \u03b1=0.6 is shown in Table 2. In Tables 1 and 2, PM and FAM denote the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method, respectively. The multipliers of the eigenvalues in Fig. 1, Table 1 and Table 2 are all    E   0   I  /  (   \u03c1   0   A   L  4  )  .  From Table 1 we can see that with the decrease of \u03b1, the error between the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method becomes bigger. Table 2 shows that the error between the proposed method and the fuzzy analytical method does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. And it can be seen that the maximal error in Tables 1 and 2 is 0.62%, which generally can satisfy the accuracy demanding in the engineering. So we can conclude that, when the fuzziness in parameters is small, the proposed method has good accuracy at various order of eigenvalue. Example 2 A five-story frame tower structure.  Consider a five-story frame structure with fuzzy parameters as shown in Fig. 3(a). Assume that the horizontal members are very rigid compared to the columns of the frame. This assumption reduces the system to only five degrees of freedom as shown in Fig. 3(b). According to the opinions of experts, the total stiffness and the mass of each story have fuzzy values, and the fuzzy values are listed in Table 3.    Fig. 4 shows the fuzzy third order eigenvalue by the proposed method. The fuzzy third order eigenvector by the proposed method are plotted in Fig. 5. If we set \u03b1=0.5 in Fig. 5, we will obtain the bounds of the third order eigenvector at \u03b1=0.5 as shown in Fig. 6. So we can conclude that, based on the fuzzy result by the proposed method, it is easy to obtain the interval result at the interested \u03b1-level. The range between lower and upper bounds of all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors at \u03b1=0.5 are listed in Table 4.    Table 5 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various \u03b1-levels. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first five eigenvalues by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at \u03b1=0.5 is shown in Table 6. In Tables 5 and 6, PM and MCS denote the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation, respectively.  From Table 5 we can see that with the decrease of \u03b1, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes bigger. Table 6 shows that the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. And it can be seen that the maximal error in Tables 5 and 6 is 0.97%, which generally can satisfy the accuracy demanding in the engineering.  When the method proposed in this paper is applied to obtain the fuzzy third order eigenvalue of this example, we can use the fuzzy parameters for the calculation directly. To obtain the fuzzy result, we only need to calculate once. The formulation of the fuzzy third order eigenvalue by the proposed method can be written as  (78)   \u03bb \u02dc  =  [  103.567 , L  ( \u03bb )  , R  ( \u03bb )   ]  ,   where  (79)  L  ( \u03bb )  =  {        \u03bb \u2212 103.567   9.815   + 1 ,     93.752 < \u03bb \u2264 103.567 ,       0 ,     \u03bb \u2264 93.752 ,       R  ( \u03bb )  =  {        103.567 \u2212 \u03bb   9.815   + 1 ,     103.567 \u2264 \u03bb < 113.382 ,       0 ,     \u03bb \u2265 113.382 .            With the above equations, we can plot the fuzzy result as Fig. 4.  If the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are used, for example, the method presented in Ref. [7], we have to transform the fuzzy parameters into interval parameters through \u03b1-cut. For this example, if five levels of \u03b1-cut ( 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1) are considered for each fuzzy parameters, the fuzzy stiffness and mass parameters have to be transformed into interval parameters as listed in Table 7. And then, we need to calculate the interval results of the fuzzy third order eigenvalue at each level of \u03b1-cut, for this example, by using the method presented in Ref. [7], we need to calculate five times to obtain the interval results as shown in Table 8. With all the interval results, the fuzzy third order eigenvalue finally can be constructed as shown in Fig. 7.  In the proposed method, the fuzzy field with r uncertain variables is not transformed into interval fields. So the governing equations are consisted of r+1 systems of equations, in which, there is one system with the zeroth-order, r systems with the first-order. For this example, r=10, so there are only 11 hierarchical systems of equations. By solving these equations, the fuzzy results can be obtained directly. When the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are used for fuzzy analysis, the fuzzy field has to be transformed into s interval fields, i.e. each of the fuzzy parameters has to be transformed into s interval parameters. So the governing equations of the conventional fuzzy finite element methods are consisted of s\u00d7(r+1) systems of equations, in which, there is s zeroth-order expanded systems of equation, s\u00d7r first-order systems. For this example, each of the 10 fuzzy parameters is transformed into 5 interval parameters, i.e. s=5, r=10, there are 55 hierarchical systems of equations. By solving these equations, only the interval results can be obtained. To obtain the fuzzy results, we have to construct the fuzzy results by the interval results. The proposed method can avoid these roundabout procedures. Therefore, the proposed method can reduce the computational cost in comparison with the conventional fuzzy finite element methods. Example 3 A 25-bar space truss.  Consider a 25-bar space truss as shown in Fig. 8. The member areas are linked into the following groups: A 1;   A   2   =   A   3   =   A   4   =   A   5   ;   A   6   =   A   7   =   A   8   =   A   9   ;   A   10   =   A   11   ;   A   12   =   A   13   ;   A   14   =   A   15   =   A   16   =   A   17   ;   A   18   =   A   19   =   A   20   =   A   21   ; and   A   22   =   A   23   =   A   24   =   A   25   . In this example, a total of ten system modal parameters, indicating the member areas, Young\u05f3s modulus and material density, are considered as fuzzy numbers and are listed in Table 9, where the variable coefficient \u03b2\u2208[0,1].    Fig. 9 shows the fuzzy first order eigenvalue of this example. From Fig. 9 we can see that when \u03b1=1 or \u03b2=0, the eigenvalue by the proposed method is deterministic, with the decrease of \u03b1 or the increase of \u03b2, the difference between the upper and lower bound becomes bigger. By setting \u03b1 of the fuzzy first order eigenvector at different interested levels, we can obtain the interval results of the fuzzy first order eigenvector at various \u03b1-levels when \u03b2=1 as listed in Table 10.    Table 11 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first ten eigenvalues by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at \u03b1=0.5, \u03b2=0.5. The comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various \u03b1-levels when \u03b2=0.5 is shown in Table 12. Table 13 represents the comparison of the lower and upper bound of the fuzzy first-order eigenvalue by the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation at various \u03b2 when \u03b1=0.5. In Tables 11, 12 and 13, PM and MCS denote the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation, respectively.   Table 11 shows that the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation does not vary so much at various order of eigenvalue. From Table 12 we can see that with the decrease of \u03b1, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes bigger. Table 13 shows that with the decrease of \u03b2, the error between the proposed method and Monte Carlo simulation becomes less. Therefore, with the increase of \u03b1 or the decrease of \u03b2, the error of the proposed method becomes less, i.e. the accuracy of the proposed method becomes better.   CONCLUSIONS   In this study, by introducing fuzzy parameters into Rayleigh quotient variation, the fuzzy variational principle for modal analysis is developed. The fuzzy finite element method is proposed as the application of the fuzzy variational principle. The proposed fuzzy finite element method can obtain the fuzzy result directly. The proposed method avoids the roundabout procedures frequently used in the conventional fuzzy finite element methods. Therefore, the proposed method can increase computational efficiency. The results of numerical examples indicate that the proposed method has good accuracy and needs less computational efforts.

In this section, some definitions of the fuzzy set theory related to the present work are given. Definition 1 (Fuzzy set). Define U as the domain,  A \u02dc  is a fuzzy subset of U and u is an element of U. The relationship between  A \u02dc  and u can be expressed as  (A.1)  u \u2192  A \u02dc   ( u )  \u2208  [  0 , 1  ]  ,   where  A \u02dc   ( u )  is the membership function of the fuzzy set  A \u02dc  , which can also be expressed as   \u03bc    A \u02dc     ( u )  .  (Fuzzy number). A fuzzy number  A \u02dc  is convex normalized fuzzy set  A \u02dc  of the real line R such that  (A.2)   {    \u03bc    A \u02dc     ( u )  : R \u2192  [  0 , 1  ]  , \u2200 u \u2208 R  }  ,   where   \u03bc    A \u02dc    is called the membership function of the fuzzy set and it is piecewise continuous.  (Peaky fuzzy number). If a bounded closed fuzzy number  A \u02dc  possess the following properties:  (1) The left shape function, L  A (x), of the fuzzy number  A \u02dc  are monotonic increasing and continuous from the right, while the right shape function, R  A (x), are monotonic decreasing and continuous, and 0 \u2264   L   A    ( x )  ,   R   A    ( x )  < 1 .  Within the kernel set of the fuzzy number  A \u02dc  , denoted by K e r  A \u02dc  , there is only one element A 0.  Then  A \u02dc  is a peaky fuzzy number and  A \u02dc  can be expressed as  (A.3)   A \u02dc  =  [    A   0   ,   L   A    ( x )  ,   R   A    ( x )   ]  ,   where A 0 is deterministic and called real value of the peaky fuzzy number  A \u02dc  .  (Linear peaky fuzzy number). If the shape functions of a peaky fuzzy number  A \u02dc  can be expressed as follows:  (A.4)    L   A    ( x )  =  {        x \u2212   A   0       a   L     + 1 ,       A   0   \u2212   a   L   < x \u2264   A   0   ,       0 ,     x \u2264   A   0   \u2212   a   L   ,         R   A    ( x )  =  {          A   0   \u2212 x     a   R     + 1 ,       A   0   \u2264 x <   A   0   +   a   R   ,       0 ,     x \u2265   A   0   +   a   R   .            Then  A \u02dc  is a linear peaky fuzzy number, where A 0 is the real value of  A \u02dc  , a  L and a  R are the left and right amplitudes of fluctuation of  A \u02dc  , respectively. With the possible low and high value of  A \u02dc  , denoted by a  l and a  h , respectively, a  L and a  R can be obtained as follows  (A.5)    a   L   =   A   0   \u2212   A   l   \u2032   ,    a   R   =   A   h   \u2032   \u2212   A   0   ,   where  (A.6)    A   l   \u2032   =  {      2   A   l   \u2212   A   0   ,       A   0   < 2   A   l   ,       0 ,       A   0   \u2265 2   A   l   ,         A   h   \u2032   = 2   A   h   \u2212   A   0   .      (\u03b1-level set). The \u03b1-level set of a fuzzy set  A \u02dc  : U \u2192  [  0 , 1  ]  , denoted by    A \u02dc    \u03b1   , is defined as    A \u02dc    \u03b1   =  {  u \u2208 U :   \u03bc    A \u02dc     ( u )  \u2265 \u03b1  }  , where \u03b1\u2208[0,1] is called the level of confidence.
