We extended DKMQ plate element to DKMQ24 element for analyzing thick and thin shell problems.      DKMQ24 takes into account the coupling between membrane and bending deformations.      We will present the convergence test results of this element compared with Q4\u03b324 element.      DKMQ24 element gives better results than Q4\u03b324 element due to the quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24, while Q4\u03b324 element used linear interpolation functions.          KEYPHRASES   DKMQ24  Quadrilateral  Thick and thin shell  Warping effect  Bending-Membrane Energy   Researches on the finite element method are still being conducted, specifically to obtain better elements. The formulation of a simple and efficient shell element which has a good accuracy in numerical analysis is highly desirable. Furthermore, the development of low-order shell finite elements is very interesting, because it enables to reduce in an important way the associated numerical costs especially for large scale non-linear analysis. A compromise between cost and accuracy must be found.  Generally, the developments of shell element are based on 3-nodal (triangular) and 4-nodal (quadrilateral) elements. The associated formulations allow to take into account a wide variety of thicknesses, irregular geometry, different boundary conditions and rough discretization.  MITC elements [1,2] are commonly used in engineering analysis and revealed to be effective in membrane-dominated and bending-dominated shell problems [3,4].  Briassoulis [5] has introduced an analytical approach to study the asymptotic behavior of shell elements. The asymptotic behavior of finite shell elements in membrane-dominated, bending-dominated and mixed membrane-bending shell problems were evaluated using the explicit expressions for the characteristic asymptotic displacement.  By using the Assumed Natural Strains (ANS) and Discrete Shear method to define the shear strains, the development of three nodes DKT [6] and four nodes DKQ [7] elements for thick plate bending has been proposed by Batoz and Lardeur [8,9]. These two elements rely on plate equilibrium equations including shear (Reissner\u2013Mindlin model). The first one, called Discrete Shear Triangular (DST) has 9 d.o.f and the second one, called Discrete Shear Quadrilateral (DSQ), has 12 d.o.f. DST and DSQ elements converge towards to DKT and DKQ plate elements for thin plate problems.  A modified DST element, called DST-BK element, based on the formulation proposed by Bergan and Nygard [10], has been proposed by Batoz and Katili [11]. This element is free of shear locking and the numerical results obtained converge towards the reference solutions for all benchmark tests.  Katili [12,13] has introduced DKMT and DKMQ element to analyze thick and thin plate problems. These elements are based on Reissner\u2013Mindlin [14,15] hypothesis which require only C 0 continuity. In the case of thin plate problem, the solution obtained with DKMT element converges to DKT [6] element, while the solution obtained with DKMQ element converges to DKQ [7] element. DKMT and DKMQ elements revealed to be free of shear locking and passed the classical patch tests associated. The problem of shear locking, when the thickness of the plate decreases, is resolved using the Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method proposed by Katili [12,13]. The capability of DKMQ and DKMT plate element has been tested in [12,13] for thin and thick plate problems.  The adaptation of DKMT and DKMQ elements to hybrid-mixed formulations has been introduced by Thermanto [16] and Ayad et al. [17,18]. This hybrid-mixed formulation is free of shear locking and passed all patch test from thick to thin plate analysis. Ayad et al. [19] has extended the formulation of DKMT element to laminated composite plate structures. Another ANS method, called DRM, based on the additional degrees of freedom on the middle edges, has been proposed by Onate et al. [20,21]. Although the triangular DRM element uses additional degrees of freedom in each sides of the element, the results are similar as those obtained with DMT element [22]. The formulation of DKMT plate element with facet shell element using the optimal membrane triangular OPT element for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of laminated composite structures has been introduced by Khosravi et al. [23].  Regarding the good results of DKMQ plate element, it is interesting to develop a shell element based on the generalization of DKMQ. In this paper, we will introduce a new quadrilateral shell element constituted of 4 nodes and 6 degrees of freedom per node (Section 2). This element has 24 d.o.f, is called Discrete Kirchoff-Mindlin Quadrilateral 24 (DKMQ24). Using the Naghdi shell theory [24\u201327] and the formulation of shell element of [28], we have extended DKMQ plate element to DKMQ24 shell element. Its formulation is based on a generalization of the Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method including the transverse shear effects, and is valid for thin and thick shells.  The incomplete quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24 element constitute one of the originality of the approach proposed and give the better performance in bending behavior. Warping effects are taken into account by computing the coupling bending-membrane in the curvature equations. This DKMQ24 element passed the classical patch tests in several thick and thin shell configurations and converged without shear locking towards the reference solution for benchmarks tested.  The main characteristics of DKMQ24 shell element are as follows:  a. The geometry of the shell is represented by a set of quadrilateral elements with bilinear approach in which four of these nodes are non-coplanar [29,30].  Vector position    x \u02dc    p   in the middle surface is continuous, but the direction of normal vector  n \u02dc  maybe discontinuous between two elements adjacent.  The approximation of displacement function or translation in the middle surface   u   p    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )  uses a linear function, while the interpolation of rotations  \u03b2 \u02dc   (  \u03be , \u03b7  )  uses an incomplete quadratic function [29,30].  Shear deformation vector is approximated independently (Assumed Strain Shear Displacement Field).  There are 24 degrees of freedom on each element, six degrees of freedom for each node i  (    U   i   ,   V   i   ,   W   i   ,   \u03b8     X   i     ,   \u03b8     Y   i     ,   \u03b8     Z   i      ) following the global coordinates system.  The formulation uses the Modified Functional elements of Hu-Washizu [31].  DKMQ24 element behaves in accordance with the theory of Kirchhoff and Reissner\u2013Mindlin, due to the use of a shear influence factor \u03d5  k which is a function of shell thickness ratio (L/h).  The interpolation of a vector position    x \u02dc    q   at an arbitrary point q, when expressed as functions of the parametric coordinate \u03be, \u03b7, z on the reference element:  (1)     x \u02dc    q    (  \u03be , \u03b7 , z  )  =    x \u02dc    p   ( \u03be , \u03b7 ) + z   n \u02dc   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )      (2)     x \u02dc    q    (  \u03be , \u03b7 , z  )  =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    x \u02dc    i    + z  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    n \u02dc    i      The notations used are the following:        x   \u02dc     p   : the coordinates of point p (X, Y, Z) in the global coordinate system which is defined in (\u03be,\u03b7, z=0).        x   \u02dc     q   : the coordinates of point q (X  q , Y  q  , Z  q ) in the global coordinate system (\u03be,\u03b7,z).        x   \u02dc     i   : the nodal coordinates i (X  i  , Y  i  , Z  i ) is the Cartesian global coordinate system   i   \u02dc   ,   j   \u02dc   ,   k   \u02dc   .   N  i (\u03be,\u03b7) is the shape function of the quadrilateral element, depending on the parametric coordinates (\u03be,\u03b7) in the reference element (see Table 1).        n   \u02dc     i   : \u3008        n   X i         n   Y i         n   Z i        \u3009 denotes the normal direction at the surface of the element in the nodal i (see Fig. 1).  Relation differential element in Cartesian and natural coordinate systems at point p can be written as:  (3)  d    x \u02dc    p   =  {      d X       d Y       d Z      }  =  [         a \u02dc    1          a \u02dc    2        ]   {      d \u03be       d \u03b7      }    where    a \u02dc    1   and    a \u02dc    2   are tangential vectors in direction \u03be (\u03b7=constant) and \u03b7 (\u03be=constant).    a \u02dc    1   and    a \u02dc    2   are called the covariant base. Vector    a \u02dc    1   and    a \u02dc    2   (see Fig. 2) are given by:  (4)     a \u02dc    1   =    x \u02dc    p , \u03be   =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i , \u03be       x \u02dc    i     ;     a \u02dc    2   =    x \u02dc    p , \u03b7   =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i , \u03b7       x \u02dc    i      where   N   i , \u03be     and     N   i , \u03b7   are the first derivatives of shape functions N  i with respect to \u03be and \u03b7.

If the four nodes in an element are coplanar, then the matrix  [  b c  ]  =  [ 0 ]  (because  n \u02dc  is constant for this element).

K=5/6 is the shear correction factor of Reissner\u2013Mindlin.  The equilibrium equation of the each side must be added to Eq. (40):  (41)    T   s   =   M   s , s   +   M   m s , m     The constitutive law for the bending moment on each side:  (42)    M   s   =   D   b    (    \u03b2   s , s   + \u03c5    \u03b2   m , m    )   ;    M   m s   =   D   b     (  1 \u2212 \u03c5  )  2   (    \u03b2   s , m   + \u03c5    \u03b2   m , s    )  ;   D   b   =   E    h  3    12  (  1 \u2212   \u03c5  2   )      The kinematic relationship between tangential shear strain and the rotation at normal direction on each side obtained from (40)\u2013(42) is as follows [12,13]:  (43)   \u03b3  \u0332        s   =     D   b       D   s      [    \u03b2   s , s s   + \u03c5    \u03b2   m , m s   +   (  1 \u2212 \u03c5  )  2   (    \u03b2   s , m m   + \u03c5    \u03b2   m , m s    )   ]    The rotation   \u03b2   s    ( s )  and   \u03b2   m    ( s )  had been stated in (23). We get:  (44)    \u03b2   s , m m   = \u03c5    \u03b2   m , m s   = 0   We get on side k with quadratic function of \u03b2 s in s direction (23):  (45)   \u03b3  \u0332          s   k     = \u2212  2 3    \u03d5   k     \u0394 \u03b2     s   k      With :   \u03d5   k   =     D   b       D   s       12     L   k   2     =  2  K  (  1 \u2212 \u03c5  )     (      h  2      L   k   2      )    The factor   \u03d5   k   (characterizing the influence of shear) maintains the consistency of element. The factor h 2/L  k  2, in that equation explains why DKMQ24 element behaves as the Reissner\u2013Mindlin theory for thick shell and as the Kirchhoff\u2013Love theory for thin shell. In the thin shell problems, the factor h 2/L  k  2 is close to zero, so that the transversal shear deformation is automatically ignored, as a result the shear locking resolved by this Discrete Kirchhoff Mindlin method.

We only recall here the modified Hu-Washizu principle, whose details can be found in reference [31]. Hu-Washizu principle reads:  (48)  \u03a0 =   \u03a0   int   \u2212   \u03a0   e x t     \u03a0   int   =   \u03a0   int   m   +   \u03a0   int   b   +   \u03a0   int   s    ;   \u03a0   e x t   =  \u222b A   w   f   z   d A  +  \u222b s    (  w   f   z   +   \u03b2   x     m   x   +   \u03b2   y     m   y    )   d s    where   \u03a0   int   m   ,   \u03a0   int   b         and     \u03a0   int   s   respectively membrane, bending and shear strain energy. f  z is the distributed load in the z direction and  (49)    \u03a0   int   s   =  1 2   \u222b A    \u3008   \u03b3  \u0332    \u3009   [    H   s    ]   {   \u03b3  \u0332    }  dA  +  \u222b A    \u3008 T \u3009   (   { \u03b3 }  \u2212  {   \u03b3  \u0332    }   )  dA    By stating the variation \u03a0 with respect to T (shear force), we get the condition:  (50)   \u222b A    \u3008  \u03b4 T  \u3009   (   { \u03b3 }  \u2212  {   \u03b3  \u0332    }   )   dA  = 0   This equation which can be viewed as a constraint equation and is equivalent to:  (51)   \u222b 0    L   k      \u03b4   T     s   k      (    \u03b3     s   k     \u2212  \u03b3  \u0332          s   k      )   d s = 0  ,  k = 5 , 6 , 7 , 8      Using the kinematic relationships for transversal shear deformation, the Discrete Kirchhoff\u2013Mindlin method [12,13] can be stated on element for getting {\u03c7} and {\u03b3} as function of nodal degrees of freedom. From (51), we have:  (52)   \u222b 0    L   k      (    \u03b3     s   k     \u2212  \u03b3  \u0332          s   k      )  ds = 0   with  (53)    \u03b3     s   k     =    u \u02dc    p , s   .    n \u02dc    k   +  \u03b2 \u02dc  \u22c5    t \u02dc      s   k      ;   \u03b3  \u0332          s   k     = \u2212  2 3    \u03d5   k   \u0394   \u03b2     s   k       Therefore  (54)   \u222b 0    L   k       (     u \u02dc    p , s   \u22c5  n \u02dc  +  \u03b2 \u02dc  \u22c5    t \u02dc      s   k     +  2 3    \u03d5   k   \u0394   \u03b2     s   k      )  ds = 0    where  n \u02dc  is a unit normal vector from one point s on the side k of element. On the each side k, we have:  (55)     u \u02dc    p , s   =  1    L   k      (     u \u02dc    j   \u2212    u \u02dc    i    )   ;   \u03b2 \u02dc  .    t \u02dc      s   k     =  (   (  1 \u2212  s    L   k      )   \u03b2 \u02dc       i   +  s    L   k        \u03b2 \u02dc    j    )     t \u02dc      s   k     +  (  4  s    L   k      (  1 \u2212  s    L   k      )   )  \u0394   \u03b2     s   k       On each side, the value    n \u02dc    k   :  (56)   n \u02dc       k   =  1 2   (   n \u02dc       i   +  n \u02dc       j    )    Equivalently, we have:  (57)   1    L   k      (     u \u02dc    j   \u2212    u \u02dc    i    )     n \u02dc    k   +  1 2   (   \u03b2 \u02dc       i   +    \u03b2 \u02dc    j    )     t \u02dc      s   k     +  2 3   (  1 +   \u03d5   k    )  \u0394   \u03b2     s   k     = 0   Finally, we get:  (58)  \u2212  2 3   (  1 +   \u03d5   k    )  \u0394   \u03b2     s   k     =  1    L   k      \u3008     n \u02dc    k    \u3009   {     u \u02dc    j i    }  +  1 2   \u3008         t \u02dc      s   k     .

(71)   [ k ]  =  [    k   m    ]  +  [    k   b    ]  +  [    k   s    ]    Stiffness matrix is determined using numerical integration with Gauss integration point. Standard Gauss integration 2\u00d72 point is enough to integrate the stiffness matrix (65), (68) and (70).  Shear strain deformation energy depends on the value of factor   \u03d5   k   and this energy becomes zero if   \u03d5   k   \u2248 0 . In thin shell problem (   \u03d5   k   \u2248 0 ), the DKMQ24 element converges to DKQ24 element in reference [29]. Therefore, shear stiffness becomes zero and there is no shear locking for thin shell with the element DKMQ24.  In the field of real kinematic, there is no rotation around the normal axis (   \u03b8   z   ). Then the stiffness matrix [k] (71) will contain the value zero at the nodal variables   \u03b8     z   i     . As a result, it will arise four spurious modes at elements. If all elements are combined into a plane that is coplanar, then the sum of rigidity matrix (rigidity assemblage matrix) will become singular. Therefore, to avoid the difficulties of numerical operations (spurious modes), we used a fictitious stiffness. With the addition of fictitious stiffness, three spurious modes will vanish, while the other spurious mode will be eliminated by MacNeal stabilization [32\u201334].  (72)    \u03a0   int   =   \u03a0   int   +   \u03a0   int   \u03b8 z   +   \u03a0   int     \u03b8 z   \u00af          a. We define a fictitious stiffness such as:  (73)    \u03a0   int   \u03b8 z   =  1 2    E   h  3    12     10   \u2212 3    \u222b A    (    \u03b8   z , x     \u03b8   z , x   +   \u03b8   z , y     \u03b8   z , y    )  d A  =  1 2   \u3008    \u03b8   n    \u3009   [    k   \u03b8 z    ]   {    \u03b8   n    }       (74)    \u03b8   z    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )  =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )    \u03b8     z   i      =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )   \u3008    n   i    \u3009   {    \u03b8   n    }  =  \u3008 N \u3009   \u3008    n   i    \u3009   {        \u03b8     X   i             \u03b8     Y   i             \u03b8     Z   i          }     where:    \u3008    n   i    \u3009  =  \u3008        n     X   i           n     Y   i           n     Z   i          \u3009   ;  \u3008    \u03b8   n    \u3009  =  \u3008        \u03b8     X   1           \u03b8     Y   1           \u03b8   Z 1       \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5       \u03b8     X   4           \u03b8     Y   4           \u03b8     Z   4          \u3009    and  (75)   {        \u03b8   z , x           \u03b8   z , y        }  =   [    C  o   ]  T   {        \u03b8   z , \u03be           \u03b8   z , \u03b7        }    Matrix   [    k     \u03b8   z      ]   12 \u00d7 12   is expanded into matrix   [    k     \u03b8   z      ]    24 \u00d7 24   to adjust the nodal variables in the element stiffness matrix.  b. According to Mac Neal Stabilization, we defined also:  (76)    \u03a0   int     \u03b8 z   \u00af     =  1 2  .   E h   2 ( 1 + \u03c5 )     10   \u2212 3    \u222b A   (     \u03b8  \u00af     z   \u22c5    \u03b8  \u00af     z    )  d A =  1 2   \u3008    u   n    \u3009   [    k     \u03b8   z     \u2212    ]    {    u   n    }       (77)  Thus  the  final  form  of  stiffness  matrix  is :  [ k ]  =  [    k   m    ]  +  [    k   b    ]  +  [    k   s    ]  +  [    k     \u03b8   z      ]  +  [    k     \u03b8   z     \u2212    ]    In this example, it is important to notice that:  1. The number of rank matrix [    k     \u03b8   z      ] is three and rank of matrix [    k     \u03b8   z     \u2212    ] is one.  The addition of small fictitious stiffness [    k     \u03b8   z      ] and [    k     \u03b8   z     \u2212    ] will not affect the precision and the convergence speed. In Eqs. (73) and (76), we used a small arbitrary factor of stabilization of 10\u22123 that we found empirically. This small factor will not affect the results but enable to avoid singularities.  The matrix [    k     \u03b8   z      ] eliminates the numerical singularity in the element when the four nodes are coplanar, and eliminates three Spurious Modes, whereas the matrix [    k     \u03b8   z     \u2212    ] eliminates one spurious mode.  Finally the DKMQ24 element has rank=18, with 6 RBM (Rigid Body Motion) without any spurious modes and without any spurious constrains when the four nodes are coplanar.  The equivalent nodal force to average distributed load   f   z   leads to:  (78)    \u03a0   ext   =  \u222b A     f   z   w d A  =  \u3008    F   n    \u3009    {    u   n    }    where:  (79)   \u3008    F   n    \u3009  =  \u3008      .. .    0   0      F     Z   i        0   0   0    .. .      \u3009   i = 1 , 4 ;   F   Z i   =   f   z    \u222b A     N   i    d A       In this paper, we will compare the performance of DKMQ24 element with Q4\u03b324 element inspired by [1,2]. We can find de detail of formulation Q4\u03b324 in [28]. We can see that there are some similarities in both elements and we need only to explain the differences. The Q4\u03b324 element uses bi-linear function for both    u \u02dc    p   and  \u03b2 \u02dc  . The displacement of    u \u02dc    q   is given by:  (80)     u \u02dc    q    (  \u03be , \u03b7 , z  )  =  \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )    {        U   i           V   i           W   i        }  + z   \u2211  i = 1  4     N   i    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )    [  R N  ]       i    {        \u03b8     X   i             \u03b8     Y   i             \u03b8     Z   i          }    For membrane stiffness, Q4\u03b324 uses the same membrane element stiffness as DKMQ24 in the (65). While, for bending stiffness, we have the same equation as in (68) with  (81)   [    B   b    (  \u03be , \u03b7  )   ]  =  [    B     b   \u03b2      (  \u03be , \u03b7  )   ]    Finally for shear stiffness, Q4\u03b324 element uses modified functional of Hellinger-Reissner, where the shear deformation is given by  (82)     \u03b3 \u0332    s   =  1    L   k      \u222b 0    L   k        \u03b3   s    d s =  1    L   k      \u222b 0    L   k      (     u \u02dc    p , s   \u22c5  n \u02dc  +  \u03b2 \u02dc  \u22c5    t \u02dc    s    )   d s   where  n \u02dc  is a unit normal vector from one point s in the side k of the element. We have:  (83)     \u03b3 \u0332      s   k     =  1    L   k      \u3008     n \u02dc    k    \u3009   {   u \u02dc       j i    }  +  1 2   \u3008         t \u02dc      s   k     . R  N \u02dc  1      i      \u22ee       t \u02dc      s   k     . R  N \u02dc  2      i      \u22ee       t \u02dc      s   k     . R  N \u02dc  3      i        \u3009   {    \u03b8     x   i      }  +  1 2   \u3008         t \u02dc      s   k     . R  N \u02dc    1   j      \u22ee       t \u02dc      s   k     . R  N \u02dc    2   j      \u22ee     t \u02dc         s   k         . R  N \u02dc    3   j    \u3009   {    \u03b8     x   j      }    If (83) is applied on all four sides, then the independent parameter {    \u03b3     s   n      } is a function of degrees of freedom {u  n }, and we obtain:  (84)    {    \u03b3     s   n      }   ( 4 x 1 )   =   [    A   u    ]   ( 4 \u00d7 24 )     {    u   n    }   ( 24 \u00d7 1 )     From (39) and (84) we get:  (85)   {  \u03b3 \u0332  }  =  {       \u03b3  \u0332        x          \u03b3  \u0332        y        }  =  [    B   s    ]   {    u   n    }   with :   [    B   s    ]  =  [    B     s   \u03b3      ]   [    A   u    ]    For shear stiffness, we can obtain an equation similar to (70) with [    B   s    ] given from (85).  The convergence test introduced here includes benchmark test suggested by Mac Neal and Harder [35], are: the hemispherical shell, the Scordelis\u2013Lo roof problem, the pinched cylindrical shell with end diaphragms, the hyperbolic paraboloid shell and the twisted beam. We will present also the results for plate problems in the two last examples. In all cases, the shells are analyzed with a constant thickness. The boundary conditions are known, and there is no initial deformation.  A case which is often used to evaluate the performance of a thin hemispherical shell element (R/h=250) is presented in Fig. 8. We have free boundary conditions and 4 pieces point load. This case is introduced to prove the absence of membrane locking. The structure is divided into four sections due to the symmetry. The deflection U  A  =\u2212V  B which is a results of numerical test is presented in Table 2 and Fig. 9.  Data: R=10 m; h=0.04 m; R/h=250; P=1 N; E=6.825\u00d7107  Pa; \u03c5=0.3  Symmetry condition: V=\u03b8  X  =\u03b8  Z =0 on the side AC; U=\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  Z =0 on the side BC   Boundary condition: W=0 at the point C: Reference value [35]: U  A =\u2212V  B =0.0924 m   The reference value of calculations based on classical theory is U  A =0.0924 m. We can see in Table 2 and Fig. 9 that DKMQ24 element converges faster than Q4\u03b324 element and gives better results, closer to the reference value.  Data: L=6m; R=3m; h=0.03m; \u03d5=40\u00b0; E=3\u00d71010  Pa; \u03c5=0; fz=\u22120.625\u00d7104  Pa   Boundary condition: U=W=\u03b8  Y  =0 on the side AD   Symmetry condition: U=\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  Z =0 on the side CD; V=\u03b8  X  =\u03b8  Z =0 on the side CB   Reference value (theory of deep shell) [36]: W  B =\u22123.61cm and W  C =0.541cm  Analytical solution (theory of shallow shell) [36]: W  B =\u22123.703cm and W  C =0.525cm  The case presented in Fig. 10 is a problem which is used to compare the performance of flat facet approach, curved, and isoparametric. This structure has a cylindrical panel with free boundary conditions along the cylinder and on the other transverse direction field of the panel. Geometry and mechanical characteristics can be seen in Fig. 10. This shell has its own load (vertical distributed load) f  Z =\u22120.625\u00d7104  Pa across the surface.  Transversal shear deformations are very small, so they can be ignored, and the membrane deformation is more dominant than the bending deformation. We analyzed only a quarter of the structure because of the symmetry. In this example, membrane effect is more dominant. The results of numerical test for Q4\u03b324 and DKMQ24 elements are presented in   Tables 3\u20135, and in    Figs. 11\u201314. We observed that these elements converge to the deep shell theory solution. The results are quite similar. However, we can see once again in Tables 3 and 4 that DKMQ24 element gives better results, closer to the theoretical solution of deep shell. Table 5 and Figs. 13 and 14 present the convergence of membrane force in point B and bending moment in point C compared to the theoretical solution of shallow shell [36].  Data:   L=6m; R=3m; h=0.03m and 0.3m; \u03c5=0,3; E=3\u00d71010 Pa  Boundary condition: U=W=\u03b8  Y  =0 on the side AD   Symmetry conditions:   W=\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  X =0 on the side AB; V=\u03b8  X  =\u03b8  Z  =0 on the side BC; U=\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  Z =0 on the side CD   We consider two cases: Case 1 Reference value (R/h=100); W   C  =Eh W  C  /P=\u2212164.24  Reference value (R/h=10); W   C  =Eh W  C  /P=\u221211.351  The shell presented in Fig.15 is a pinched cylinder with two concentrated loads located in opposite direction. At both ends, there is a rigid diaphragm. This example is difficult test for the shell element which is indicating the complex deformation of the membrane where most of the structure (under concentrated load) is dominated by bending effect \u00b170%. In this case, DKMQ24 element gives better results than Q4\u03b324 element. This is due to the quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24, while Q4\u03b324 element used linear interpolation functions. Presented in two thickness ratio, R/h=100 (thin shell) and R/h =10 (thick shell). For R/h=100, an analytical solution (Kirchhoff) theory was proposed by Lindberg et al. [37] with respect to the solution of Fl\u00fcgge [38] using Fourier series. For R/h=10, the analytical solutions (the Mindlin theory) takes into account the transversal shear effects and is presented in Bhaskar and Varadan [39]. In the 2 cases, only 1/8 of the cylinder may be analyzed accounting for the symmetries. Moreover, the uniform and distorted meshes are analyzed. A bias factor of 10 was used for distorted mesh.  The numerical results (W  C versus the number the elements) obtained with the different elements for R/h=100 and 10 are presented in    Tables 6\u20139 and in     Figs. 16\u201320. We can see, in particular in Fig. 16, that DKMQ24 element converges much faster than Q4\u03b324 element. For N=10 (NELT=100), DKMQ24 has nearly converged, whereas Q4\u03b324 gives results far from the reference value. Fig. 17 presents the comparison of bending moment M  X along DC with [37] using 16\u00d716 elements. The results obtained with DKMQ24 element are closer to the reference solution than those obtained with Q4\u03b324 element. The same results are also obtained with distorted mesh in Fig. 18.  In Case 2 for R/h=10 (thick shell), results presented in Figs. 19 and 20, reveal the effects of transversal shear. Indeed, the elements DKQ24 [29] (similar to DKMQ24 element which does not take into account the effect of transversal shear   \u03d5   k   = 0 ) gives less satisfactory results than the Q4\u03b324 and DKMQ24 elements. The numerical solution does not converge at all toward the reference one. DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements give similar results for convergence in uniform and distorted meshes.  Another classic problem is the problem of a hyperbolic paraboloid shell with a distributed load in the normal direction f  z . Geometry and mechanical characteristics can be viewed in Fig. 21. This particular shell has a negative Gaussian curvature with boundary conditions in the straight line. The projection on to the Z-axis is a rectangular-shaped, with bases 2a\u00d72a, and clamped on the sides. This shell geometry corresponds to a shallow shell. Table 10 and Fig. 22 present the convergence of the deflection versus the number of elements.  Data:   a=50cm; b=10cm; h=0.8cm; E=28500kg/cm2; \u03c5=0.4   f  z =0.01 kg/cm 2: distributed load in the normal direction; Z=(b/a 2 ) XY   Boundary conditions: U=V=W=\u03b8  X  =\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  Z  =0 along sides ABCD   Reference solution [40]: Wo=2.460\u00d710\u22122  cm   We observe that the results given by Q4\u03b324 and DKMQ24 elements converge to the given reference value [40]. However, the convergence with DKMQ24 element is much faster. We present in Table 10 and Fig. 22 the results given by facet shell approach with the element we called DKQ24FP in reference [29] as a superposition DKQ plate element [7] and Q4 standard quadrilateral membrane element with 4 nodes and degree of freedom u  i  , v  i in each node i. The fictitious stiffness for   \u03b8   z   and MacNeal stabilization is added into DKQ24FP element stiffness to avoid rigid body motion. We can see clearly the facet shell DKQ24FP element gives the different results with DKMQ24 shell element proposed in this paper. In this example DKMQ24 gives the same results with DKQ24 in reference [29] since the shear deformations are very small.  Data: Rotation=90\u00b0 between O and A    L=12m; b=1.1m; h=0.0032m and 0.32m; E=29 \u00d7106  Pa; \u03c5=0.22  Boundary condition: U=V=W=\u03b8  X  =\u03b8  Y  =\u03b8  Z  =0 on the support  Geometry of the middle surface with respect to s and \u03b8:   X=s cos \u03b8; Y=2\u03b8L/\u03c0; Z=s sin \u03b8; 0 \u2264\u03b8\u2264\u03c0/2; \u22120.5b \u2264 s \u2264+0.5b   This example addressed is a shell with helicoidal shaped with one side clamped. A concentrated load is applied on the other side ( Fig. 23). This test was introduced by MacNeal and Harder [35] and became one of major tests to validate a new shell element.  This case presents important difficulties for the elements resulting from the flat facet shell approach in quadrilateral shaped. The element facet shell DKQ24FP in [29] (superposition of membrane and flexural/transversal shear, without the curved side) gives the same difficulties. We can see in    Tables 11\u201314 and    Figs. 24\u201327 the results given by DKQ24FP are divergent from reference values. The reference solution is based on the beam theory (which ignores the deformation in transverse direction), and with or without taking into account the transverse shear deformation. For this example we can see that the DKMQ24 proposed in this paper gives the same results with DKQ24 element in reference [29]. The results obtained for h=0.0032m and 0.32m are presented in Figs. 24\u201327 and Tables 11\u201314 with meshing 2\u00d712, 4\u00d724, 6\u00d736 and 8\u00d748 respectively. DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements give satisfactory and similar results converging towards the reference solution.    Fig. 28 shows square clamped plate under uniform loading. We will analyze only the section ABCD due to the symmetry. The rapport L/h=10 and distorted mesh are employed. The numerical results obtained with DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements are presented in Table 15 and Fig. 29. Note that for plate problems, Q4\u03b324 element has been developed following [1,2] and is therefore similar to MITC4 element for plate. DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements give satisfactory and similar results converging towards the reference solution. Moreover, the results reveal that DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 are not sensitive to distortion.  Data:   L=1000; h=100; E=10.92; \u03c5=0.3; q=1  Boundary conditions: W=\u03b2 Y  =0 along sides AB and W=\u03b2 X  =0 along sides AD   Symmetry conditions: \u03b2 X  =0 along sides BC and \u03b2 Y  =0 along sides CD   Reference solution [41]: W  C =62.830  The problem considered in Fig. 30 is a Morley\u2032s skew plate which sometimes poses severe difficulties for numerical methods since bending moments possess a singularity at the obtuse corner. This case has been already analyzed in [13]. The numerical results for vertical displacement at plate center obtained with DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements for L/h=1000 are reported in Table 16 and Fig. 31. DKMQ24 elements give satisfactory results and converge towards the reference solution.  Data:   L=100; h=0.1; E=10.92; \u03c5=0.3; q=1  Boundary conditions: W=0 on ABCD   Reference solution [42]: W  O =0.408   CONCLUSIONS   The new four nodes and 24 dof quadrilateral shell element DKMQ24, using incomplete quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation, has been evaluated and presented in thick and thin shell problems. The results of the analysis show that this element passed all convergence test presented, without membrane locking. It is also free of shear-locking, as for the DKMQ plate element [13].  In membrane dominated problems (Scordelis\u2013Lo roof for instance), the results are quite similar because both elements use the same membrane stiffness matrix. In bending dominated problems (pinched cylindrical shell), results obtained with DKMQ24 element are much better, in particular the convergence is faster than with Q4\u03b324 element. This is due to the quadratic interpolation functions for the rotation used in DKMQ24. For thick pinched cylindrical shell, DKMQ24 and Q4\u03b324 elements give similar results for convergence while DKQ24 element [29] gives less satisfactory results because it does not take into account the effect of transversal shear. For shell analysis which has a negative Gaussian curvature presents in the examples 4.4 and 4.5, we can show the element DKMQ24 proposed in this paper is not a facet shell model and the element gives the different results with DKQ24FP facet shell model.
