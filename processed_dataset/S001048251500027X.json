BtoxDB provides an interface for all available protein structural data on TA systems.      BtoxDB provides three modules: \u201cSearch\u201d, \u201cBrowse\u201d and \u201cStatistics\u201d.      BtoxDB allows refined search and friendly acquisition of contents.          KEYPHRASES   Toxin\u2013antitoxin (TA) systems  Structural database  Persistence  Alternative antimicrobials  Drug targets   Toxin\u2013antitoxin (TA) systems are genetic modules found in plasmids and chromosomes of both bacteria and archaea [1]. These systems are composed of a toxin and an antitoxin that neutralizes the toxic effect of the toxin. In general, the antitoxin is less stable than the toxin and is rapidly degraded in specific conditions, leaving the toxin free to act on its cellular targets [2]. The toxin is always a protein, but the antitoxin can be an RNA or a protein [3].  TA systems are currently grouped into five types based on the mode of interaction between toxin and antitoxin and the nature of the antitoxin [3]. In type I, the antitoxin is an antisense RNA that suppresses toxic effect by binding to its mRNA [4,5]. In type II, both the toxin and antitoxin are translated to produce proteins, and the antitoxin neutralizes the toxicity of the toxin protein by binding directly to it [2,6]. In type III, a RNA antitoxin directly neutralizes the protein toxin [7,8]. In type IV, the antitoxin is a protein that neutralizes the toxin, acting as an antagonist [9]. In type V, antitoxin directly cleaves the toxin-encoding mRNA [10].  The TA system has been related to several events in cell physiology such as plasmid maintenance [11,12], stress resistance [13], protection from bacteriophages [7], persistence [14] and regulation of biofilm formation [15].  The mode of action of TA systems has served as a model for the development of biotechnological products of interest to molecular biology [3,16]. TA-system components have been used to enhance clonal selection and protein expression in living bacterial cells [17\u201319]. Furthermore, because TA systems are able to repress growth or kill cells and are widely present in bacterial genomes, they are considered as potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs [3,20,21].  Antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogenic bacteria constitute a major health problem worldwide. Resistance mechanisms may be due to genetic changes that block antibiotic activity. There are also persisters, which are bacterial cells that are highly tolerant to different types of antibiotics but are genetically identical to their nontolerant kind [22]. Growth arrest is the most established hypothesis to explain the multidrug persistence displayed by certain subpopulations. In this context, TA systems are probably the major causes of the phenomenon and act as a starvation response [23]. Consequently, the interest in persister cells has increased dramatically in recent years, and research in this area could have important implications for the development of novel therapeutics to eradicate persisting subpopulations [23].  Pharmaceutical companies have dedicated major efforts to obtain new versions of old classes of antibiotics, abandoning programs to develop new types of antimicrobial drugs from unexplored targets. In consequence, there is a diminished overall capacity to generate novel antimicrobials [20,24\u201326]. Therefore, there is a need for innovative antimicrobials to solve this problem, and TA modules could be a way to improve antimicrobial treatments. One strategy is to obtain a putative disruptor of the TA interaction [3,16,20,21,27]. Another strategy is to design small molecules based on toxin\u2013cellular target interaction that can poison the cell in manner similar to the natural action of toxin compounds [3,28,29].  Considering the importance of TA modules as new potential unexplored targets for the development of alternative antimicrobials and the importance of structural data for this purpose, this study presents a web-based system, named BtoxDB, that was created to maintain a resource of all available protein structural information on TA systems.  The BtoxDB is a record-based database implemented as a MySQL relational database. It is managed and updated using the SQL (Structured Query Language) and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) scripting languages. BtoxDB runs on a Linux platform with an Apache web-server. Web interfaces were developed using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) and JavaScript languages. AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) was used to create dynamic pages allowing asynchronous data queries. All charts that provide data visualization are dynamically constructed using Google Charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/).  The BtoxDB database was developed to provide the following three modules: (i) a \u201cSearch\u201d module, which performs a search from keywords; (ii) a \u201cBrowse\u201d module, which retrieves data from predefined options; and (iii) a \u201cStatistics\u201d module, which returns statistical data from the database.  The main data resources were the PDB (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) and UniProt (www.uniprot.org) databases. When necessary, additional information was obtained from the Entrez database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). All data from these databases were extracted using sequence homology searches and keyword searches for relevant toxin\u2013antitoxin modules. These data were filtered for redundancy using specialized literature and also our previous knowledge about toxin\u2013antitoxin systems. The data flow of the BtoxDB is briefly illustrated in Fig. 1.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Some bioinformatics tools have been developed to facilitate research on TA systems such as RASTA-Bacteria [30], which is a tool for identifying toxin\u2013antitoxin loci in prokaryotes. TADB database [31] is a resource for type II toxin\u2013antitoxin loci in bacteria and archaea. In addition to genomic data, this database also provides some structural data but is limited to displaying a figure of the 3D structure and a link to PDB database. In this work, the BtoxDB database was developed to create a resource of all available structural information on toxin\u2013antitoxin systems in prokaryotes, not limited to the type II group. Furthermore, detailed data are provided through three user-friendly modules.  The \u201cSearch\u201d and \u201cBrowse\u201d modules were developed to allow queries on entries deposited in the BtoxDB database. In the access screen for both tools, is possible to select only literature search or only structural data from crystallography or NMR experiments. The \u201cSearch\u201c module should be used when the user is interested in a data search based on keywords without filtering by families, superfamilies or specific species. The \u201cBrowse\u201c module should be used when the user is interested in browsing the complete listing of BtoxDB database entries or browsing all data from one or more toxin/antitoxin family, toxin/antitoxin superfamily or one or more species.  In both modules, the literature search initially returns entries in a table ( Fig. 2). Each result, containing information about article title, authors and journal, is displayed in one row of the table. The complete reference of selected entries can be downloaded using the \u201cGet references\u201c button on the bottom of the display page. For each entry, a \u201cmore\u201d option on the right of the display page shows detailed content for each reference in a new screen. Apart from the title, authors and journal, the new screen displays the PMID and DOI numbers, both linking to the respective external databases, and the abstract of the reference.  When the user searches for structural data, in both modules, a screen is shown with the data in a table containing information about the experimental method, PDB ID, molecule name and organism ( Fig. 3). The PDB files or primary sequences of selected entries can be downloaded using the \u201cGet PDBs\u201c and \u201cGet sequences\u201c buttons, respectively, located on the bottom of the display page. For each entry, on the right of the display page, a \u201cmore\u201d option shows detailed information on each structure, in a new screen, including experimental data, molecule names, 3D structure, secondary structure, primary sequences and related articles. An example of the detailed data available on a solved structure is shown in Fig. 4.  The \u201cStatistics\u201d module provides an easy way to obtain statistical data on solved structures of TA systems. In this module, it is possible to obtain statistical data grouped by toxin/antitoxin families, toxin/antitoxin superfamilies or by microorganisms. Table 1 and Table 2 show current structures deposited in the BtoxDB database, grouped by microorganism, for toxins and antitoxins respectively. At present, the BtoxDB contains records of over 120 molecules, including TA complexes and free toxins/antitoxins.   CONCLUSIONS   One way to combat the emergence of bacterial multidrug resistance is to increase research focused on the development of new drugs against these resistant pathogens. TA modules are potential targets for new ligands that may contribute to the elimination of persister cells that remain even after treatment with antibiotics. In this regard, structural information of TA systems is fundamental and has major academic and industrial value [32]. Considering this information, the BtoxDB database was developed to provide a user-friendly web-based resource for all available protein structural information on toxin\u2013antitoxin systems.  The database provides three modules that allow users to search, acquire contents and access statistical data and also provides direct links to external databases. The platform developed here is very useful for researchers interested in TA systems and can be freely accessed at http://www.gurupi.uft.edu.br/btoxdb/.  The BtoxDB database will be updated monthly as new structural data for TA modules are published. New tools will also be incorporated into BtoxDB to allow additional data analysis.  None declared.

REFERENCES", "highlights": "Purpose Toxin\u2013antitoxin (TA) systems are diverse and abundant genetic modules in prokaryotic cells that are typically formed by two genes encoding a stable toxin and a labile antitoxin. Because TA systems are able to repress growth or kill cells and are considered to be important actors in cell persistence (multidrug resistance without genetic change), these modules are considered potential targets for alternative drug design. In this scenario, structural information for the proteins in these systems is highly valuable. In this report, we describe the development of a web-based system, named BtoxDB, that stores all protein structural data on TA systems.  Methods The BtoxDB database was implemented as a MySQL relational database using PHP scripting language. Web interfaces were developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The data were collected from the PDB, UniProt and Entrez databases. These data were appropriately filtered using specialized literature and our previous knowledge about toxin\u2013antitoxin systems.  Results The database provides three modules (\u201cSearch\u201d, \u201cBrowse\u201d and \u201cStatistics\u201d) that enable searches, acquisition of contents and access to statistical data. Direct links to matching external databases are also available.  Conclusions The compilation of all protein structural data on TA systems in one platform is highly useful for researchers interested in this content.
