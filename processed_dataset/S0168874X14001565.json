KEYPHRASES   Cyclic symmetry  Element-free Galerkin scaled boundary method  Heat transfer  Block-circulant  Partitioning algorithm   As a semi-analytical method [1\u20134], the scaled boundary method (SBM) is more efficient than finite element method (FEM) for problems involving unbounded domain or/and local singularity [5\u20137], and has been combined with FEM [3\u20136], meshless local petrov-galerkin method (MLPGM) [7], or element-free galerkin method (EFGM) [8,9] to tackle with elastostatics or heat transfer problems. However, higher computing expense, mainly caused by an eigenproblem, is one of the barriers for the further application of SBM.  The present paper aims at reducing computing cost of EFG-SBM in the heat transfer analysis for a special kind of structure, i.e. the structure with cyclic symmetry. By exploiting the cyclic symmetry of this kind of structure, it is proved that the matrices of eigenvalue and system equations of EFG-SBM of the cyclically symmetrical structures are block-circulant so long as a kind of symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system is adopted. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations are partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Actually there was some previous work concerned with exploitation of the cyclic symmetry in elastostatics [10\u201316,18] or heat transfer analysis [17], but it seems no report relevant to EFG-SBM.  This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, EFG-SBM for steady-state heat transfer is derived in Section 2 and rotationally periodic symmetrical structures are introduced in Section 3. Then, Section 4 presents a partitioning algorithm for EFG-SBM of the special structure and the proof of the block-circulant property of the global EFG-SBM coefficient matrices is given in Appendix A (i.e. Section 7). Two numerical examples are presented in Section 5 to assess the computational convenience and efficiency of the proposed method. Discussion and conclusions from this study are given in Section 6.  The governing equation of heat conduction problems in the steady state can be written in a tensor form [21]   (1)  k   \u2207  2  T + Q = 0   where k denotes thermal conductive parameter, T represents temperature, Q is a source related term.  The boundary conditions are specified by [21]   (2)  T =  T \u00af   on    \u0393   1        (3)  \u2212 k  (    \u2202 T   \u2202 n    )  =   q   n    on    \u0393   2        (4)  \u2212 k  (    \u2202 T   \u2202 n    )  = h ( T \u2212   T   a   )  on    \u0393   3     where \u0393 =   \u0393   1   +   \u0393   2   +   \u0393   3   denotes the boundaries of the problem.  T \u00af  and q  n are the prescribed temperature and heat flux, on the corresponding boundaries, respectively. h and T  a refer to the convection heat transfer coefficient and environmental temperature.  A weak form of Eqs. (1)\u2013(4) can be written as [21]   (5)   \u222b V   \u03b4 T   (  k   \u2207  2  T + Q  )   d V \u2212  \u222b    \u0393   2      \u03b4 T  (  k   \u2202 T   \u2202 n   +   q   n    )   d \u0393 \u2212  \u222b    \u0393   3      \u03b4 T  [  k   \u2202 T   \u2202 n   + h  (  T \u2212   T   a    )   ]   d \u0393 = 0   where \u03b4 T stands for a weighting function.  The application of integral by parts leads to  (6)  \u2212  \u222b V   \u03b4 T Q  d V +  \u222b V   k  (    \u2202 \u03b4 T   \u2202 x     \u2202 T   \u2202 x   +   \u2202 \u03b4 T   \u2202 y     \u2202 T   \u2202 y    )   d V +  \u222b    \u0393   2      \u03b4 T    q   n    d \u0393 +  \u222b    \u0393   3      \u03b4 T h  (  T \u2212   T   a    )   d \u0393 = 0      The scaled boundary method introduces such a \u03be-s coordinate system by scaling a defining curve relative to a scaling centre (x 0, y 0) selected within the domain, as shown in Fig. 1. The coordinate \u03be runs from the scaling centre towards the curve, and has values of zero at the scaling centre and unity at the curve. The coordinate s specifies a distance around the boundary from an origin on the boundary [6,7].  For the 2-D problem, the scaled and Cartesian coordinate systems are related by [6,7]   (7a)  x =   x   0   + \u03be   x   s   ( s )      (7b)  y =   y   0   + \u03be   y   s   ( s )      In the SBM, an approximate solution is sought in the form  (8)  T ( \u03be , s ) = N ( s ) T ( \u03be )   where N ( s ) is a matrix of shape functions and T ( \u03be ) refers to a nodal vector of temperature along the curve with constant \u03be.  The approximate derivatives of temperature are  (9)   {        \u2202 T ( \u03be , s )   \u2202 x           \u2202 T ( \u03be , s )   \u2202 y        }  =   B   1   ( s ) T   ( \u03be )   , \u03be   +  1 \u03be    B   2   ( s ) T ( \u03be )   where  (10)    B   1   ( s ) =   b   1   ( s ) N ( s ) =  1  | J |    {        y   s     ( s )   , s         \u2212   x   s     ( s )   , s        }  \u22c5 N ( s )      (11)    B   2   ( s ) =   b   2   ( s ) N   ( s )   , s   =  1  | J |    {      \u2212   y   s   ( s )         x   s   ( s )      }  \u22c5 N   ( s )   , s        (12)  | J | =   x   s   ( s )   y   s     ( s )   , s   \u2212   y   s   ( s )   x   s     ( s )   , s     where N   ( s )   , s   refers to the derivative of N ( s ) with respect to s.  Assume  (13)  \u03b4 T ( \u03be , s ) = N ( s ) \u03b4 T ( \u03be )   where \u03b4 T ( \u03be ) refers to a set of n functions analytical in \u03be.  Thus  (14)   {        \u2202 \u03b4 T ( \u03be , s )   \u2202 x           \u2202 \u03b4 T ( \u03be , s )   \u2202 y        }  =   B   1   ( s ) \u03b4 T   ( \u03be )   , \u03be   +  1 \u03be    B   2   ( s ) \u03b4 T ( \u03be )      In the absence of internal heat generation or source term, substituting Eqs. (8) and (9) and (13) and (14) into Eq.

In Fig. 2, N=6.  Designating the boundary of \u03a9 as \u0393 that is naturally divided into N identical parts   \u0393   i   ( i = 1 ,  \u2026  , N ).   \u0393   i   is arranged in an anti-clock wise sequence i.e.  (44)  \u0393 =   \u0393   1   \u222a   \u0393   2   \u22c5 \u22c5 \u22c5 \u222a    \u0393   N   ,    \u0393   i   =   \u03a8   i   :   \u0393   1     Eq. (44) means that   \u0393   i   can be obtained from   \u0393   1   , which is called \u2018basic region\u2019 and can be arbitrarily chosen from those identical parts. For any node or integration point in the basic region, there are certainly other N\u22121 different nodes or integration points, which are located symmetrically on the other N\u22121 symmetry regions. All these N nodes constitute a set of symmetric nodes, which is called symmetric node orbit, and is designated as O  A    (45)    O   A   =  {    A   1   ,   A   2   , \u2026 ,   A   N    }       In Fig. 2, it is readily seen that the six interface nodes B  i ( i = 1 ,  \u2026  , N ) constitute orbit O  B . Only those nodes that are located on the internal part and the \u2018right\u2019 interface of   \u0393   1   are regarded as belonging to the basic region. Only B 1 is regarded as belonging to   \u0393   1   and B 2 will then be regarded as belonging to   \u0393   2   .  Consider a cyclically symmetric structure with order N and there are m nodes at each symmetry region. T in the x\u2013y coordinate system is described by  (46)    T  T  =  [    T   1 T   ,   T   2 T   , \u2026 ,   T   N T    ]    where T  i belongs to the ith symmetry region.  In such an ordering way, the coefficient matrices   Z   11   ,   Z   12   ,   Z   21   and   Z   22   in Eq.

It can also be proved that only 1/N part of the matrices   E   0   ,   E   1   ,   E   2   and   E   3   needs to generate, respectively.

Substituting Eq. (49) into Eq. (31) and left-multiplying both sides of Eq.

Eq. (58) indicates that Eq.

Q \u0332  is constituted by  (63)   Q \u0332  =  [     Q \u0332   1  ,    Q \u0332   2  , \u2026 ,    Q \u0332   N   ]    where    Q \u0332   j  = [    q \u0332    1   j   , \u2026    q \u0332    i   j   , \u2026    q \u0332    m   j   ] , and    q \u0332    i   j   can be constituted in a similar way.  Therefore  (64a)   \u03a6 \u0332  =  [         \u03a6 \u0332    0   \u204e                \u03a6 \u0332    1   \u204e            \u2026             \u03a6 \u0332    n s p   \u204e        ]       (64b)   Q \u0332  =  [         Q \u0332    0   \u204e                Q \u0332    1   \u204e            \u2026             Q \u0332    n s p   \u204e        ]    where n s p =  [  N / 2  ]  .  The dimension of    \u03a6 \u0332    0   \u204e   is m, the dimension of    \u03a6 \u0332    i   \u204e   , (  i = 1 , \u2026 , n s p \u2212 1  ) is 2m, and the dimension of    \u03a6 \u0332    n s p   \u204e   is m or 2m if N is even or odd.  Substituting Eq. (64) into Eq. (53) then gives  (65)   K \u0332  =  [         Q \u0332    0   \u204e      \u03a6 \u0332    0   \u204e \u2212 1                Q \u0332    1   \u204e      \u03a6 \u0332    1   \u204e \u2212 1            \u2026             Q \u0332    nsp   \u204e      \u03a6 \u0332    nsp   \u204e \u2212 1        ]    and  (66)     K \u0332    r r      T \u0332    r   =    P \u0332    r    r = 0 , 1 , 2 , \u2026 ,  [  N / 2  ]    where  (67)        T \u0332    1   =    T \u0332    0   ;        T \u0332   N  =    T \u0332    N / 2    ( when  N  is  even )      [     T \u0332    p T   ,     T \u0332    q T    ]  =    T \u0332    r   T     (  p = 2 r ,  q = 2 r + 1 ;  r = 1 , 2 , \u2026 ,  [   (  N \u2212 1  )  / 2  ]   )          Therefore, instead of solving the original eigenvalue problem defined by Eq. (28), one only needs to solve a series of independent small sub-eigenvalue-problems described by Eq. (60).  When all boundary conditions are rotationally symmetric,  (68)    P  1  =   P  2  = \u22ef =   P  N       (69)     P \u0332   2  =    P \u0332   3  = \u22ef =    P \u0332   N  = 0 ,     P \u0332   1  =  N     P \u00af   1       One only needs to solve the first sub problem in Eq. (69) because other [N/2] sub problems have zero solutions.  No matter  T \u00af  and q  n are rotationally symmetric or not, the solution of Eq. (28) can be computationally partitioned via Eq. (60) when convection heat transfer boundaries are distributed periodically, and K can be generated via  (70)  K =   E  m   K \u0332    E   m T     When prescribed temperature distribution is also rotationally symmetric, Eq. (31) can be solved by solving a series of smaller independent problems described by Eq. (66). When prescribed temperature distribution is not rotationally symmetric, Eq. (31) can be solved using K generated via Eq. (70).  Consequently the major computing expense of EFG-SBM can be significantly reduced by the exploration of cyclic symmetry.  Two numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm.  Materials parameters are k = 1  W / ( m \u22c5 k ) and Q = 0  W /   m   3   .  All the computations are carried out on a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2100 CPU @3.10GHz   Numerical Example 1 considers a regular 16-edge polygonal plate as shown in Fig. 3 where R = 1  m . At corner point of each side,  T \u00af  = 5  \u00b0 C , the boundary conditions of two opposite sides of plate follow \u2212 k  (  \u2202 T / \u2202 n  )  =   q   n   where   q   n   = 5  W /   m  2  . 100 nodes are uniformly arranged at each sub-cyclic symmetry region. All geometric, physical properties and essential boundary conditions are cyclic symmetry with N=16.  A comparison of computing expense is given in   Tables 1\u20133 exhibit comparisons of computing accuracy with ANSYS (18179 nodes and 5922 8-node-quadrangle finite elements). The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.80%.    Fig. 4 shows the contour plots of temperature in the whole domain. The results show that the contours from EFG-SBM are continuous and smooth, and the distribution is virtually identical with ANSYS solution in the whole domain.   Numerical Example 2 considers a regular octagonal gear as shown in Fig. 5 where   R   1   = 1  m and   R   2   = 2  m . At point 2,  T \u00af  = 5  \u00b0 C , the boundary conditions of the right side edges of four corners follow \u2212 k  (  \u2202 T / \u2202 n  )  =   q   n   where   q   n   = 1  W /   m  2  , other left side edges follow   q   n   = \u2212 1  W /   m  2  . 30 nodes are uniformly arranged at every edge. Both geometry and physical properties are cyclic symmetry with N=8, but essential boundary condition is not cyclic symmetry.    Table 4 gives a comparison of computing time.  Tables 5 and 6 exhibit a comparison of computing accuracy with ANSYS (6960 nodes and 2181 8-node-quadrangle finite elements). The line 1 is from point A (\u22120.46, 0.19) to B (\u22121, 0). The relative error of solutions given by the proposed algorithm and ANSYS is less than 0.015%.  The comparison of thermal gradient vector sum at corner points between EFG-SBM and ANSYS is showed in Fig. 6. The thermal gradient vector sum at corner points from No. 1 to 9 corresponding to the heat flux boundaries is higher than other corner points. The thermal gradient vector sum at sharp corner points is higher than those at concave corner points. The distribution curve of thermal gradient vector sums of EFG-SBM is consistent with ANSYS.     1. The major computing cost of EFG-SBM consists of two parts, i.e. i) the expense on generating K, ii) the expense on solving eigenvalue problem. By utilizing the cyclic symmetry and partitioning algorithm, the major computing cost can be significantly reduced as shown in Tables 1 and 4.  In comparison with ANSYS, a sufficient computing accuracy can be provided by the proposed algorithm, as shown in Tables 2, 3, 5, 6 and Fig. 6.   CONCLUSIONS   The purpose of this paper is to explore the cyclic symmetry to improve the computing efficiency for the EFG-SBM based steady-state heat transfer analysis for two-dimensional rotationally periodic structures, and the major contributions include  a) The matrices of the eigenvalue and system equation of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system is proved to be block-circulant so long as a kind of symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system is adopted.  A partitioning algorithm is presented to partition the eigenvalue and system equations into a number of smaller problems which can be solved independently, thereby the computational efficiency is significantly improved.  Since the proposed partitioning algorithm facilitates to be parallelized, a higher computing efficiency can be expected.

The superscript represents which symmetric region where the point locates, and the subscript indicates which orbit the point belongs to, as illustrated in Fig. A1 where   x   j   i   ,   x   j   i + t   are nodal coordinates, and   x   q   i   ,   x   q   i + t   are coordinates of integration points.   x   j   i + t   and   x   q   i + t   can be matched by a rotation of angle t \u204e \u03b8 from points   x   j   i   and   x   q   i   , respectively. \u03b8 = 2 \u03c0 / N was defined in Sect. 3.  In a symmetric system, points belonging to the same orbit (see Fig. A1) follow:  (A1)    x   j   i + t   =   T   t   \u22c5   x   j   i   ,    T   t   =  [      cos  t \u03b8     \u2212  sin  t \u03b8       sin  t \u03b8     cos  t \u03b8      ]   t = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , N \u2212 1   where   x   j   i + t   =   [    x   j   i + t   ,   y   j   i + t    ]  T  ,   x   j   i   =   [    x   j   i   ,   y   j   i    ]  T  .

The eigenvalue matrices of EFG-SBM for the rotationally periodic system are proved to be block-circulant under a symmetry-adapted reference coordinate system. Furthermore, both the eigenvalue and system equations can be partitioned into a number of smaller independent problems which are solved by a partitioning algorithm. Numerical examples are given to verify the proposed algorithm in term of computing accuracy and efficiency."}
