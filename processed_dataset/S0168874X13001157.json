The present element is based on various four unknown shear deformation theories.      Numerical examples are presented to verify the accuracy of the present element.      The proposed element is capable of modeling both very thin and thick plates.          KEYPHRASES   Finite element formulation  Functionally graded plate  Shear deformation theory  Bending  Vibration   Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are heterogeneous composite materials usually made from a mixture of ceramics and metals. The mechanical properties of FGM vary smoothly and continuously from one surface to the other and thus eliminate the stress concentration at the interface of the layers found in laminated composites. One of the reasons for increasing the use of FGMs in many engineering structures is that their material properties can be tailored to different applications and working environments. The increase in FGM applications requires the development of accuracy models to predict their responses. An interesting literature review of the modeling and analysis of FGMs can be found in the paper of Birman and Byrd [1]. An updated review of more recent works on 3D exact and analytical solutions of functionally graded (FG) plates can be found in Jha et al. [2]. Thus the following literature review addresses mainly the development of finite element models based on plate theories.  Since the shear deformation effects are more pronounced in thick plates or plates made of advanced composites like FGMs, shear deformation theories such as first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT) and higher-order shear deformation theories (HSDTs) should be used to analyze FG plates. A significant number of finite element analyses of FG plates have been performed using shear deformation theories. Reddy [3] presented the finite element formulations for FG plates based on his third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT) [4]. Qian et al. [5,6] and Gilhooley et al. [7,8] employed the meshless local Petrov\u2013Galerkin method (MLPG) and higher-order shear and normal deformable plate theory to analyze the thick FG plates. Ferreira et al. [9,10] used the TSDT and meshless collocation method with multiquadric radial basis functions to study the bending and vibration responses of FG plates. A C0 continuous finite element based on the HSDT was developed by Pradyumna and Bandyopadhyay [11] to study the free vibration of FG curved panels. The bending and free vibration analyses of FG plates were investigated by Zhao et al. [12,13] using the FSDT and element free kp-Ritz method. A nine-node isoparametric finite element based on the HSDT was developed by Talha and Singh [14] to study the free vibration and bending responses of FG plates. The nonlinear bending behavior of FG plate with different boundary conditions was studied by Singha et al. [15] using the FSDT and a four-node finite element based on the exact neutral surface position. Based on the FSDT, Nguyen-Xuan et al. [16,17] investigated the bending, buckling and free vibration responses of FG plates using the edge-based smoothed finite element method (ES-FEM) [16] and node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) [17]. The bending and free vibration behavior of sandwich FG plates are studied by Natarajan and Manickam [18] using a QUAD-8 shear flexible element along with a HSDT. More recently, Valizadeh et al. [19] and Tran et al. [20] used the non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) based isogeometric method to study the static and dynamic responses of FG plates. Mantari and Guedes Soares [21] presented a HSDT and its finite element formulation for bending analysis of FG plates.  It should be noted that the FSDT gives acceptable results, but it requires a shear correction factor. Although the HSDTs do not require a shear correction factor, their equations of motion are more complicated than those of the FSDT. Therefore, Shimpi [22] develops a simple plate theory by separating the transverse displacement into bending and shear parts. The most interesting feature of Shimpi's theory is that it has fewer unknowns and governing equations than the FSDT and does not require a shear correction factor. Based on Shimpi's work, several four unknown shear deformation theories were developed using different shape functions such as polynomial functions [23\u201330], sinusoidal functions [31] and hyperbolic functions [32]. However, these works [23\u201334] are limited to the analytical solutions of simply supported plates or plates with two opposite edge simply supported and remaining ones arbitrary. The development of finite element model of these four unknown shear deformation theories is therefore necessary.  The aim of the present work is to develop a displacement-based finite element model of various four unknown shear deformation theories for the bending and free vibration analyses of FG plates with arbitrary boundary conditions. A C1 continuous four-node quadrilateral plate element with ten degrees of freedom per node is employed. Lagrangian linear interpolation functions are used to describe the primary variables corresponding to the in-plane displacements whereas Hermitian cubic interpolation functions are considered for the transverse displacement. Convergence test and comparison studies are performed for thin and very thick plates to demonstrate the accuracy of the present formulation. Numerical results are presented to examine the effects of volume fraction index, thickness ratio and boundary condition on the responses of FG plates.  Consider a rectangular FG plate with the length a , width b , and thickness h . The x-, y-, and z-coordinates are taken along the length, width, and height of the plate, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. The displacement field of various four unknown shear deformation theories is derived based on the following assumptions: (1) the in-plane and transverse displacements are partitioned into bending and shear components; (2) the bending components of in-plane displacements are similar to those given by classical plate theory (CPT); and (3) the shear components of in-plane displacements give rise to higher-order variations of shear strains and hence to shear stresses through the plate thickness in such a way that the shear stresses vanish on the top and bottom surfaces. Based on these assumptions, the displacement field of various four unknown shear deformation theories is given in a general form as  (1)    u   1   ( x , y , z , t ) = u ( x , y , t ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   b     \u2202 x   \u2212 f ( z )   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 x     u   2   ( x , y , z , t ) = v ( x , y , t ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   b     \u2202 y   \u2212 f ( z )   \u2202   w   s     \u2202 y     u   3   ( x , y , z , t ) =   w   b   ( x , y , t ) +   w   s   ( x , y , t )   where u and v are the in-plane displacements on the middle plane along the coordinates ( x , y );   w   b   and   w   s   are the bending and shear components of transverse displacement, respectively; and f ( z ) is a shape function determining the distribution of the transvese shear strains and shear stresses through the plate thickness. The shape functions f ( z ) are chosen to satisfy the stress-free boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate, thus a shear correction factor is not required. In this study, three different shape functions derived by different researchers are considered: polynomial functions based on Shimpi [22]   (2a)  f ( z ) = \u2212  z 4  +  5 3      z  3      h  2      sinusoidal functions based on Touratier [35]   (2b)  f ( z ) = z \u2212  h \u03c0   sin  (    \u03c0 z  h   )    and hyperbolic sine functions based on Soldatos [36]   (2c)  f ( z ) = z \u2212 h  sinh  z h  + z  cosh  1 2       In addition, the four unknown FSDT (i.e., f ( z ) = 0 ) recently developed by Thai and Choi [33,34] is also considered in this study. It is worth noting that the works of Thai and Choi [33,34] are only limited to analytical solutions plates with simply supported boundary conditions, whereas the present work deals with finite element solutions of plates with arbitrary boundary conditions.  The non-zero strains are given as  (3)   {        \u03b5   x           \u03b5   y           \u03b3   x y        }  =  {        \u03b5   x   0           \u03b5   y   0           \u03b3   x y   0        }  + z  {        \u03ba   x   b           \u03ba   y   b           \u03ba   x y   b        }  + f ( z )  {        \u03ba   x   s           \u03ba   y   s           \u03ba   x y   s        }   {        \u03b3   y z           \u03b3   x z        }  = g ( z )  {        \u03b3   y z   s           \u03b3   x z   s        }    where  (4a)   {        \u03b5   x   0           \u03b5   y   0           \u03b3   x y   0        }  =  {        \u2202 u   \u2202 x           \u2202 v   \u2202 y           \u2202 u   \u2202 y   +   \u2202 v   \u2202 x        }  ,   {        \u03ba   x   b           \u03ba   y   b           \u03ba   x y   b        }  =  {      \u2212     \u2202  2    w   b     \u2202   x  2          \u2212     \u2202  2    w   b     \u2202   y  2          \u2212 2     \u2202  2    w   b     \u2202 x \u2202 y        }  ,   {        \u03ba   x   s           \u03ba   y   s           \u03ba   x y   s        }  =  {      \u2212     \u2202  2    w   s     \u2202   x  2          \u2212     \u2202  2    w   s     \u2202   y  2          \u2212 2     \u2202  2    w   s     \u2202 x \u2202 y        }  ,   {        \u03b3   y z   s           \u03b3   x z   s        }  =  {        \u2202   w   s     \u2202 y           \u2202   w   s     \u2202 x        }       (4b)  g ( z ) =  {      1 \u2212  f \u2032  ( z )     for  f ( z ) \u2260 0      \u03ba    for  f ( z ) = 0         with   \u03ba  2  being a shear correction factor.

Clearly, when the shear deformation effect is ignored (   w   s   = 0 ), Eq. (5) yields the equations of motion of the CPT. Thus, the finite element formulations developed herein will be free from shear locking.

Consider a FG plate made from a mixture of two material phases, for example, a metal and a ceramic as shown in Fig. 1. The material properties of FG plates are assumed to vary continuously through the thickness of the plate by a power law distribution as  (9)  P ( z ) =   P   m   + (   P   c   \u2212   P   m   )   (   1 2  +  z h   )  p    where P represents the effective material property such as Young's modulus E , mass density \u03c1 , and Poisson's ratio \u03bd ; subscripts m and c represent the metallic and ceramic constituents, respectively; and p is the volume fraction exponent.

(8) is developed. A C1 four-node quadrilateral element with ten degrees of freedom per node is used. As shown in Eq. (8), the weak forms require that the in-plane displacements u and v be once differentiable and C0-continuous, whereas the bending and shear components of transverse displacement   w   b   and   w   s   must be twice differentiable and C1-continuous. Thus, the displacements are expressed over each element as a combination of Lagrangian linear interpolation functions   \u03c8   j   for u and v and Hermitian cubic interpolation functions   \u03c6   j   for   w   b   and   w   s   :  (14)  u ( x , y , t ) =  \u2211  j = 1  m     \u03c8   j   ( x , y )    u   j   e   ( t ) v ( x , y , t ) =  \u2211  j = 1  m     \u03c8   j   ( x , y )   v   j   e   ( t )    w   b   ( x , y , t ) =  \u2211  j = 1  n     \u03c6   j   ( x , y )   \u0394   b j   e   ( t )    w   s   ( x , y , t ) =  \u2211  j = 1  n     \u03c6   j   ( x , y )   \u0394   s j   e   ( t )    where (   u   j   e   ,   v   j   e   ) denote the values of ( u , v ); and (   \u0394   b j   e   ,   \u0394   s j   e   ) denote the values of (   w   b   ,   w   s   ) and their derivatives with respect to x and y . In the case of confirming element, the four nodal values associated with (   w   b   ,   w   s   ) are  (15)  {   \u0394   b   e   } =   {   w   b   e   ,    w   b , x   e   ,    w   b , y   e   ,    w   b , x y   e   }  T  {   \u0394   s   e   } =   {   w   s   e   ,    w   s , x   e   ,    w   s , y   e   ,    w   s , x y   e   }  T       For rectangular elements as shown in Fig. 2, the interpolation functions   \u03c8   j   and   \u03c6   j   for the j th node are given in terms of the natural coordinates ( \u03be , \u03b7 ) as [37]   (16)    \u03c8   j   =   1 4   ( 1 +   \u03be   j   \u03be ) ( 1 \u2212   \u03b7   j   \u03b7 )      (17)    \u03c6   j 1   =   1  16      ( \u03be +   \u03be   j   )  2  ( \u03be   \u03be   j   \u2212 2 )   ( \u03b7 +   \u03b7   j   )  2  ( \u03b7   \u03b7   j   \u2212 2 )   \u03c6   j 2   = \u2212   1  16      \u03be   j     ( \u03be +   \u03be   j   )  2  ( 1 \u2212 \u03be   \u03be   j   )   ( \u03b7 +   \u03b7   j   )  2  ( \u03b7   \u03b7   j   \u2212 2 )   \u03c6   j 3   = \u2212   1  16      ( \u03be +   \u03be   j   )  2  ( \u03be   \u03be   j   \u2212 2 )   \u03b7   j     ( \u03b7 +   \u03b7   j   )  2  ( \u03b7   \u03b7   j   \u2212 1 )   \u03c6   j 4   =   1  16      \u03be   j     ( \u03be +   \u03be   j   )  2  ( \u03be   \u03be   j   \u2212 1 )   \u03b7   j     ( \u03b7 +   \u03b7   j   )  2  ( \u03b7   \u03b7   j   \u2212 1 )      Substituting Eq.

Several types of FG plates are considered, and their material properties are given in Table 1. Seven types of boundary conditions as shown in Fig. 3 are considered. For the finite element analysis, a 2 \u00d7 2 Gauss rule is used to evaluate the stiffness and mass matrices of an element. To reduce computational cost, quarter-plate models are used for the CCCC, SCSC, SSSS, and SFSF boundary conditions, and half-plate models are used for the SSSC, SFSC, and SFSS boundary conditions (see Fig. 3). In         Tables 4\u201310, the results of four different theories are computed with the \u201cPresent (poly)\u201d, \u201cPresent (sin)\u201d, \u201cPresent (sinh)\u201d and \u201cPresent (FSDT)\u201d notations refereed to the shear deformation theories based on the polynomial, sinusoidal, hyperbolic sine and zero functions, respectively. In the case of \u201cPresent (FSDT)\u201d, the shear correction factor is taken as 5/6. The following dimensionless forms are used:  (25)   w \u00af  =   10 w   E   c     h  3      q   0     a  4    ,   w ^  =   100 w   E   m     h  3    12 ( 1 \u2212   \u03bd  2  ) q   a  4    ,   \u03b2 \u00af  = \u03c9 h     \u03c1   c   /   E   c     ,   \u03c9 \u00af  =   \u03c9   a  2   h      \u03c1   c   /   E   c          Convergence study is carried out to determine the uniform mesh size at which the deflection and natural frequency converge. A SSSS Al/Al2O3-1 square plate subjected to sinusoidal loads is considered. The plate thickness ratio a / h is taken to be 10. Dimensionless deflection  w \u00af  and fundamental frequency  \u03b2 \u00af  of the plate are presented in Table 2 for various values of power law index p . The present results obtained from finite element solution of polynomial functions based on Shimpi [22] with several mesh sizes are compared with its analytical solutions [25,30]. It can be observed that the present solutions approach analytical solutions when the number of discretized finite elements increases. It is clear from the results presented in Table 2 that the convergence of the finite element results to analytical solutions is very good, and the dimensionless deflections and frequencies converge for the uniform mesh size of 8 \u00d7 8. However, the mesh size of 4 \u00d7 4 with sufficient accuracy will be used in subsequent investigations due to computational cost. The computational time for the mesh size 4 \u00d7 4 is also given in Table 3 for different analyses. Although the use of C1 continuous element in the present study increases the degrees of freedom per node up to ten, the computational time of the present model is a little under 0.1 and 12s for static and free vibration analyses, respectively. It should be noted that the present model is benefit than the meshfree method and isogeometric analysis in term of convergence rate. For example, the present model converges for the meshing of 4 \u00d7 4, while the meshfree method [9\u201310,13] and isogeometric analysis [20] converge for the meshing of 11 \u00d7 11.    Example 1 The first example is performed for thin to thick isotropic Levy-type plates (i.e., rectangular plates with two parallel edges simply supported and the remaining two edges having arbitrary boundary conditions) under uniform loads. Since the bending results of FG Levy-type plates are not available in the literature, only isotropic Levy-type plates ( p = 0 ) are used herein for the verification. Dimensionless deflections  w ^  are presented in Table 4 for various values of aspect ratio b / a and thickness ratio a / h . The obtained finite element solutions are compared with the analytical solutions reported by Zenkour [38] based on a mixed first-order shear deformation theory (MPT). It should be noted that the MPT proposed by Zenkour [38] is based on the relationships between the CPT and FSDT in which the shear deformation results can be obtained form the results of CPT without using any shear correction factor. It can be seen that the finite element results obtained in this study are in good agreement with the analytical solutions given by Zenkour [38] for both thin and thick plates. As expected, it can be seen that the present finite element formulation is free from shear locking when a thin plate with a / h = 10,000 is analyzed. It can be seen that the influence of shape functions f  ( z )  on the responses of isotropic plates is negligible since the higher-order and first-order shear deformation theories give results close to each other.    Example 2 In the next example, thick Al/ZrO2-1 square plates ( a / h = 5) subjected to uniform loads are analyzed. Table 5 contains dimensionless deflections  w ^  of SSSS and CCCC plates for various values of power law index p . The obtained results are compared with those reported by Gilhooley et al. [7], Nguyen-Xuan et al. [17], and Lee et al. [39]. It is worth noting that the results of Gilhooley et al. [7] are obtained using a quasi-3D theory and MLPG method, whereas the results generated by Nguyen-Xuan et al. [17] and Lee et al. [39] are obtained using the FSDT and the node-based smoothed finite element method (NS-FEM) and element-free kp-Ritz method, respectively. It can be seen that four different theories give results close to each other, and their solutions are in good agreement with available results. Slight differences among existing results may be due to the use of different plate theories and solution approaches as well as the adoption of different methods to estimate effective properties of FG plates (Gilhooley et al. [7] adopted Mori\u2013Tanaka scheme whereas the authors and Refs. [17,39] used the rule of mixture).    Example 3 The next example is performed for thin and thick SSSS Al/Al2O3-1 square plates subjected to sinusoidal loads. The obtained dimensionless displacements  w \u00af  are compared with quasi-3D solutions given by Neves et al. [40\u201342] and Carrera et al. [43,44] in Table 6. It should be noted that the works of Neves et al. [40\u201342] and Carrera et al. [43,44] are implemented using Carrera's unified formulation. However, the quasi-3D solutions of Neves et al. are derived based on sinusoidal [40], hyperbolic [41], and cubic [42] variations for the in-plane displacements and quadratic variation for the transverse displacement, while the analytical [43] and finite element [44] quasi-3D solutions of Carrera et al. are obtained based on fourth-order variations for both in-plane and transverse displacements ( N = 4 ). In addition, the quasi-3D solutions account for thickness stretching effect (i.e.,   \u03b5   z   \u2260 0 ), which is not included in present solutions. Again, the obtained results are in good agreement with quasi-3D solutions. The results from Table 6 also indicate that the difference between higher-order shear deformation theories ( f  ( z )  \u2260 0 ) and first-order shear deformation theory ( f  ( z )  = 0 ) is dependent not only on the thickness ratio a / h but also on the power law index p . This difference becomes significant for small thickness ratio and large power law index. For example, for the thick plate ( a / h = 4 ), the differences between higher-order and first-order shear deformation theories are 0.08% and 5.23% for the case of p=1 and 10, respectively. However, for the thin plate ( a / h = 100 ), these differences are negligible. This means that the inclusion of shape functions f  ( z )  in higher-order shear deformation theories will give a better prediction of responses of thick FG plates.    Example 4 SSSS Al/Al2O3-1 square plates with the thickness ratio a / h varied from 2 to 20 are analyzed. This example aims to verify the accuracy of the present formulation in predicting the frequency of very thick FG plates with a / h = 2. Table 7 contains dimensionless fundamental frequency  \u03c9 \u00af  of FG plates with various values of thickness ratio and power law index. The results obtained from four different four unknown shear deformation theories are compared with quasi-3D solutions [45] and those predicted by FSDT [13,16,46] and TSDT [29]. It can be seen that the obtained results are in excellent agreement with quasi-3D solutions [45] even for the case of very thick plates with a / h = 2 in which the shear deformation effects are more pronounced. Similar to the previous example, the results in this example also reveal that the difference between higher-order and first-order shear deformation theories becomes significant for small thickness ratio and large power law index.    Example 5 In this example, moderately thick CCCC square plates ( a / h = 10) consist of different FGMs are considered. The mechanical properties FGMs are given in Table 1. Table 8 presents dimensionless fundamental frequencies  \u03c9 \u00af  obtained in this study and those reported by Zhao et al. [13] using the FSDT and element-free kp-Ritz method. Again, a close agreement between the results is obtained for all FG plates with various values of power law index p .    Example 6 The last example is performed for thin to thick FG Levy-type square plates. This example aims to verify the accuracy of the present formulation for FG plates with different boundary conditions. Two types of FG plates are considered: (i) Al/Al2O3-1 for SCSC and SSSC boundary conditions and (ii) Al/ZrO2-1 for SFSC, SFSS, and SFSF boundary conditions. Tables 9 and 10 show dimensionless fundamental frequency  \u03c9 \u00af  of square plates for various values of thickness ratio and power law index. The obtained results are compared with analytical solutions of FSDT reported by Hosseini-Hashemi et al. [46]. It can be seen that the obtained results are in good agreement with FSDT solutions [46] for all boundary conditions, thickness ratio and power law index.  Based on the present solutions, comprehensive results for deflection and fundamental frequency of Al/Al2O3-1 square plates under uniform loads are presented in  Tables 11 and 12, respectively, for different boundary conditions, thickness ratio and power law index. The results are calculated from the finite element model based on polynomial functions [22]. In each table, the thickness ratios a / h are taken to be 5 (corresponding to thick plates), 10, 20 (corresponding to moderately thick plates), 50 and 100 (corresponding to thin plates), while six different values of power law index p are examined. In addition, seven combinations of boundary conditions are considered. Parts of Tables 11 and 12 are also plotted in    Figs. 4\u20137 for illustration purposes. The following points can be noticeable from Tables 11 and 12 and Figs. 4\u20137:  (1) Regardless of boundary condition and power law index, increasing the thickness ratio results in a reduction of deflection (see Fig. 5) and an increase in frequency (see Fig. 7). This is due to the effects of shear deformation.  Regardless of boundary condition and thickness ratio, increasing the power law index will reduce the stiffness of FG plates, and consequently, leads to an increase in deflection (see Fig. 4) and a reduction of frequency (see Fig. 6). This is due to the fact that higher values of power law index correspond to high portion of metal in comparison with the ceramic part, thus makes such FG plates more flexible.  Regardless of power law index and thickness ratio, increasing constraints at the edges of plates leads to reducing deflection and increasing frequency. Such behavior is due to the fact that higher constraints at the edges increase the flexural rigidity of the plate leading to lower bending and higher vibration responses.   CONCLUSIONS   Finite element formulation of various four unknown shear deformation theories was developed for bending and vibration analyses of FG plates. The present theories account for the shear deformation effects without using any shear correction factors. A four-node quadrilateral finite element with ten degrees of freedom per node is developed using Lagrangian and Hermitian interpolation functions to describe the primary variables corresponding to the in-plane displacements and transverse displacement, respectively. Since the present theories have strong similarity with the CPT, their finite element model is free from shear locking as demonstrated in the first example. The comparison studies show that the present finite elements of three different theories give results close to each other, and their solutions are in good agreement with the existing results.  It should be noted that the thickness stretching effect is ignored in the present study. However, the present formulation can be extended in the future work to account for the thickness stretching effect by using higher-order variations for transverse displacements through the thickness. Then, the influence of considering the thickness stretching on the bending and vibration responses of FG plates will be investigated and discussed.
