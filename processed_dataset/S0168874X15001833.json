The multilayered composite plate is reduced dimensionally by the transformation matrix.      The method is easily extended into dynamic analysis by time integration algorithm.      The method shows the consistency with extended multiscale finite element method.      Some static and dynamic examples reveal the high accuracy and efficiency.          KEYPHRASES   Dynamic analysis  Substructure  Composite beam and plate  Extended multiscale finite element method  Higher-order boundary condition   Composite materials exhibit excellent performance, such as high strength, light weight, noise reduction, energy absorption and high-temperature resistance, which have been widely applied to the fields of structure control [1], spacecraft [2] and helicopter rotor [3]. In the above practical engineering, a lot of composite structures possessing one or two dimensions much smaller than others are reducible structures dimensionally, such as sandwich beams and plates, laminated plates, multilayered lattice structures. Due to these rapidly increasing popularity in many real applications, considerable attentions have been paid to predict and control their properties with an accurate and general model in the past several decades. Moreover, the increasing manufacturing techniques of composite materials are probable to fabricate novel materials with designed microstructures to meet the increasing performance requirements. Although the traditional FEM is widely accepted and used for the analysis by meshing all the microstructural details with fine-grids, it is not an efficient and practical approach to capture the micro-scale characteristics which needs the inordinate computational cost.  During the past years, there have been a lot of multiscale or coupling methods considered by a framework of the small deformation elastic or elasto-plastic theory for composite materials [4]. The most typical methods include the asymptotic homogenization method [5,6], the multilevel finite element method (FE2) [7,8], the representative volume element method (RVE) [9], the heterogeneous multiscale method (HMM) [10,11], multiscale methods based on Nitsche method [12,13], multiscale methods based on boundary conditions transfer [14,15], domain decomposition type methods [16,17] and other homogenization type methods [18,19] etc. Otherwise, many recent researchers focused on the cases of beam and plate structures based on homogenization concepts. Caillerie [20] and Kohn and Vogelius [21] considered the homogenization of heterogeneous periodic linear elastic plates, then developed to linear elastic beam-like structures with periodicity by Buannic and Cartraud [22] and Cartraud and Messager [23]. Moreover, a remarkable effort had also been made in the masonry community to acquire the homogenized flexural features of masonry [24\u201326]. Recently, Kouznetsova et al. [27,28] developed a second-order computational homogenization to establish an upscaling procedure for beam and shell-like structures. Helfen and Diebels [29] proposed some improvements considering a plate theory with the thickness change based on the computational homogenization. Oskay [30] presented a new two-level multiscale enrichment methodology for the analysis of heterogeneous plates. The enrichments are applied in the displacement and strain levels based on the partition of unity principle and the mathematical homogenization theory. Guiamatsia [31] introduced a new approach to the linear plate theory for layered structures based on the through-thickness homogenization. Lee et al. [32,33] constructed a new model for composite plates which could have the in-plane heterogeneity due to both geometry and material based on the variational asymptotic method.  Unlike the homogenization concepts, the multiscale finite element method (MsFEM), which originates from the work presented by Babuska et al. [34,35], has been used to solve the second-order elliptic boundary value problems with high oscillating coefficients by Hou et al. [36,37]. This multiscale method has been used to analyze the fluid flow [38] and two-phase flow [39] successfully. To research the problems in the solid mechanics, Zhang et al. proposed an extended multiscale finite element method (EMsFEM) for the elastic and elasto-plastic analysis of periodic lattice truss materials [40] and continuum heterogeneous materials [41]. Recently, this method with the advantage of the convenient downscaling procedure and no periodic and scale-separation assumption was developed to the dynamic analysis [42,43], the nonlinear analysis [44,45] and the thermoelastic analysis [46,47] of multiscale heterogeneous materials. However, there are few literatures that simulate the multilayered beam and plate problems by using the idea of EMsFEM. Because the boundary conditions through the thickness direction are quite complex, which need to be applied simultaneously to reduce structures dimensionally.  In this paper, a computationally efficient method is proposed to construct complicated and higher-order boundary conditions based on the substructural boundary assumption in Section 2. This method describes the boundary of coarse grids with a concept of the transformation matrix uniformly. Moreover, the relation between the proposed method and the EMsFEM is discussed in Section 3. Afterwards, different kinds of higher-order boundary conditions and multilayered plate theories are introduced in Section 4, and the proposed method is extended into dynamic problems in Section 5. Finally, the global\u2013local higher-order boundary conditions are constructed for comparison with other methods to analyze the sandwich beam, the multilayered beam and the composite lattice structure in Section 6, and then followed by a summary in Section 7.  With regards to the multilayered composite beam and plate problems, it is not efficient to analyze microscopic characteristics of such materials and structures with the detailed FEM. However, these problems often have the multiscale features which can be assumed and simplified. The fine-scale problem with the given mechanical and thermal load of such materials and structures can be solved by the upscaling computation which is shown in Fig. 1. Then, the following coarse-scale computation and downscaling computation can be carried out easily and the real stress and strain information at the fine scale can be obtained simultaneously.  In the two-level issue, the common base functions of FEM are used to describe the fine grids, while the higher-order base functions are used to construct the transformation matrix to describe the coarse grids. In the coarse-scale problem, the physical domain can be discretized by a series of coarse grids, while each coarse grid can be discretized by a series of fine grids in the fine-scale problem which are considered as a substructure and shown in Fig. 2.  In this section, the fine-scale problem with fine grids is discussed by the proposed method. The equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of a certain coarse element s are obtained by the upscaling computation and substructure scheme.  Firstly, a substructure condensation scheme is discussed and each coarse element can be seen as a substructure which is assembled by several fine grids. The static equilibrium equation of the assembled substructure s can be written as follows according to boundary degrees of freedom (DOFs) and internal DOFs:  (1)   [        K   B B   s         K   B I   s           K   I B   s         K   I I   s        ]   {        u   B   s           u   I   s        }  =  {        F   B   s           F   I   s        }  .   where the subscript B means boundary DOFs, and the subscript I means internal DOFs, and s is the number of the coarse grid.  For instance, the boundary and internal DOFs of the two-dimensional substructure in Fig. 2 are written as  (2)   {   u   B   s   } =   [   {   u   1   }  T      {   u   2   }  T     {   u   3   }  T     {   u   4   }  T     {   u   a   }  T   \u22ef    {   u   h   }  T  ]  T  ,  {   u   I   s   } = {   u   i   } ,    where,  (3)   {   u   1   } =   [   u   1 x      u   1 y   ]  T  .       By the static condensation method, the equivalent static equation of boundary DOFs can be obtained by condensing internal DOFs. This process can be achieved by Gaussian elimination  (4)   [   K   B   s ( * )   ] {   u   B   s   } = {   F   B   s ( * )   } ,    where,  (5)   [   K   B   s ( * )   ] = [   K   B B   s   ] \u2212 [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] ,       (6)   {   F   B   s ( * )   } = {   F   B   s   } \u2212 [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   {   F   I   s   } .       Secondly, the upscaling computation is introduced to obtain the reduced coarse grid. The higher-order base functions are assumed to describe the coarse grid which have different forms for different problems as follows:  (7)   { u } =  [   N ^  ( \u03be , \u03b7 )  ]  {   u   E   s   } ,    where the subscript E means nodal DOFs of coarse grids,  (8)   {   u   E   s   } =   [   u   1   T      u   2   T      u   3   T      u   4   T   ]  T  .       For example, if the base functions of the bilinear quadrilateral element are selected to describe the coarse grid, the interpolation functions for the displacements can be written as  (9)   [   N ^  ( \u03be , \u03b7 )  ]  =  [         N ^    1      0       N ^    2      0       N ^    3      0       N ^    4      0     0       N ^    1      0       N ^    2      0       N ^    3      0       N ^    4        ]  ,   where,  (10)      N ^    i   =  1 4  ( 1 +   \u03be   i   \u03be ) ( 1 +   \u03b7   i   \u03b7 )  ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) ,    where \u03be and \u03b7 are the local coordinates of the coarse grid, and  \u2212 1 \u2264 \u03be , \u03b7 \u2264 1  .  In order to improve the accuracy of the two-level analysis, we can also employ more complicated and nonlinear base functions to describe the coarse grid, such as the rational higher-order interpolation functions that follow. Moreover, the displacement continuity can be guaranteed by the base functions of coarse grids (Eq. (9)), because the same interpolation functions are used by each coarse element and the boundary displacements of each coarse element are consistent. If the nonlinear base functions are employed, the boundary displacements of the coarse element are actually the piecewise linear expression of the nonlinear base functions between the nodes of fine element edges. Therefore, each coarse grid has more fine elements, the boundary displacements of the coarse element are more close to the nonlinear base functions. The displacement continuity along the fine element edges is also preserved.  Due to the assumption of the base functions of coarse grids, the boundary DOFs  {   u   B   s   }  shown in Fig. 2 are expresssed by nodal DOFs  {   u   E   s   }  of coarse grids through a transformation matrix as follows  (11)   {   u   B   s   } = [ T ] {   u   E   s   } ,    where the boundary transformation matrix can be constructed by Eq. (7),   \u03be   h   and   \u03b7   h   are the local coordinates of the boundary node h in Fig. 2, The local coordinates of each boundary node of the substructure in Fig. 2 are substituted into Eq. (7) such that  (12)   [ T ] =  [       N ^  (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03b7   1   )        N ^  (   \u03be   2   ,   \u03b7   2   )      \u22ee       N ^  (   \u03be   h   ,   \u03b7   h   )      ]  .       For example, the boundary nodes of the substructure are distributed uniformly in Fig. 2. The local coordinates of the boundary node 1 and a     \u03be   1   = \u2212 1  ,    \u03b7   1   = \u2212 1  ,    \u03be   a   = \u2212 1 / 3  ,    \u03b7   a   = \u2212 1  . The corresponding interpolation functions are written as  (13)    N ^  (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03b7   1   ) = [    I   0   0   0    ] ,   N ^  (   \u03be   a   ,   \u03b7   a   ) =  [       2 3  I      1 3  I    0   0     ]  .       Others interpolation functions can also be obtained from Eq. (9). Therefore, the form of the transformation matrix is dependent on the selection of the base functions of coarse grids (Eq. (9)) which can be written as  (14)     [ T ]   24 \u00d7 8   =   [     I   0   0   0     2 3  I      1 3  I    0   0   0   0     1 3  I      2 3  I      0   I   0   0     1 3  I      2 3  I      2 3  I      1 3  I    0   0   0   0     0   0   I   0   0   0     1 3  I      2 3  I      2 3  I      1 3  I    0   0     0   0   0   I   0   0   0   0     1 3  I      2 3  I      2 3  I      1 3  I      ]  T  ,    where  [ I ]  is a two-dimensional unit matrix.  It can be seen that the base functions of the bilinear quadrilateral element are consistent with the linear boundary condition and the boundary DOFs vary linearly with the nodal DOFs of coarse grids. By applying the transformation matrix, boundary DOFs can be transformed into the nodal DOFs of coarse grids. The equivalent static equation of coarse grids is  (15)   [   K   E   s   ] {   u   E   s   } = {   F   E   s   } ,    where,  (16)   [   K   E   s   ] =   [ T ]  T  [   K   B   s ( * )   ] [ T ] =   [ T ]  T  [   K   B B   s   ] [ T ] \u2212   [ T ]  T  [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] [ T ] ,       (17)   {   F   E   s   } =   [ T ]  T  {   F   B   s ( * )   } =   [ T ]  T  {   F   B   s   } \u2212   [ T ]  T  [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   {   F   I   s   } .       If the transformation matrix is a unit matrix, the coarse grids are degenerate into common substructures. It turns out that the proposed method has less DOFs in the coarse-scale computation which is different from the traditional substructure method.  In the above section, the upscaling procedure of the equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of a certain coarse element is talked about. With the same method, all the equivalent stiffness matrices and load vectors of coarse elements of the structure can be obtained. Afterwards, the traditional FEM can be applied on the coarse meshes, which reduces the DOFs significantly in the coarse-scale computation.  The global stiffness matrix and load vector of the overall structure at the coarse scale are obtained as follows:  (18)   [   K  *  ] =  A  s = 1  M  [   K   E   s   ] ,       (19)   {   F  *  } =  A  s = 1  M  {   F   E   s   } ,    where  A  s = 1  M  is a matrix assembled operator, and M is the total number of coarse elements.  Therefore, the traditional FEM is carried out on coarse elements, and the coarse-scale displacement vector can be obtained by solving the following equation:  (20)   [   K  *  ] {   u  *  } = {   F  *  } .       By taking advantage of the transformation matrix and the substructure method, the downscaling computation can be applied easily and the real stress and strain information at the fine scale can be obtained simultaneously in the two-level computation as well as the macroscopic displacements of the overall structure. The nodal DOFs of fine grids can be solved by the transformation matrix and the nodal DOFs of coarse grids. The mesh consistency and displacement coordination of coarse grids are also guaranteed by the control matrix.  The internal DOFs of the coarse element s can be obtained by  (21)   {   u   I   s   } =   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   {   F   I   s   } \u2212   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] [ T ] {   u   E   s   } .       Since the microscopic displacement response has been solved, it is convenient to acquire the strain and stress of the fine element e by using the geometric equation and the physical equation  (22)   {   \u03b5   e   s   } = [   B   e   s   ] {   u   e   s   } ,  {   \u03c3   e   s   } = [   D   e   s   ] {   \u03b5   e   s   } .    where  [   B   e   s   ]  and  [   D   e   s   ]  are the strain\u2013displacement matrix and material property matrix of the fine element e.  In order to research the relation between the proposed method and the EMsFEM [40,41], the static equilibrium equation of the coarse element in Fig. 2 is deduced with the EMsFEM. The consistency test of EMsFEM has been introduced in Ref. [41]. The underlying idea of the method is to construct numerically the multiscale base functions to capture the micro-scale features of coarse elements in the multiscale finite element analysis which can be obtained by solving a boundary value subproblem in each coarse grid. For the solid mechanical problem, the numerical base function   N   i   is constructed by solving the static equilibrium equation in the coarse element domain   \u03a9   c   with a special boundary condition   \u0393   c   such that  (23)   L   N   i   = 0  i n    \u03a9   c     N   i     |   \u2202   \u03a9   c     =   \u0393   c    o n  \u2202   \u03a9   c   ,    where L is the calculation operator and it satisfies  Lu = d i v ( D : ( \u2207 u + \u2207   u  T  ) / 2 )  , where D is the tensor representing material properties; i denotes the nodal DOF number of the coarse element; the boundary condition   \u0393   c   will be different for the different construction approaches of the numerical base function.  Linear boundary conditions for the construction of   N   1   are shown in Fig. 3. Boundaries 12 and 14 are fixed in the y direction. On boundaries 12 and 14, the displacement in the x direction varies linearly from 1 to 0. In addition, other two boundaries, 23 and 34, are fixed in the x and y direction.  The subproblem is constructed by applying the unit displacement on each nodal DOF of the coarse grid which is shown in Fig. 3. The detailed discussion of EMsFEM can be found in Refs. [40,41]. The unit displacement is applied on the first DOF of node 1 of the coarse grid. The linear boundary condition is taken as an example where the given boundary displacements of the coarse grid can be described as  (24)   {   N   1     |   \u2202   \u03a9   c     } =   [   {   u   1   }  T     {   u   2   }  T     {   u   3   }  T     {   u   4   }  T     {   u   a   }  T   \u22ef    {   u   h   }  T  ]  T  =   [  1  0  \u22ef   2 3   0   1 3   0  \u22ef   1 3   0   2 3   0  ]  T  ,    where the boundary node numbers are shown in Fig. 2.  The unit displacement is applied on each nodal DOF of the coarse grid in turn. The eight given boundary displacements of the coarse grid can be found as  (25)   [   N   1     |   \u2202   \u03a9   c        N   2     |   \u2202   \u03a9   c      \u22ef    N   8     |   \u2202   \u03a9   c     ] = [ T ] .       The static equilibrium equation Eq. (1) in the coarse element domain s can be discretized by fine grids. The subproblem with the eight given boundary conditions is  (26)   [        K   B B   s         K   B I   s           K   I B   s         K   I I   s        ]   [        u   B   s           u   I   s        ]  =  [        F   B   s        0     ]  ,   where the numerical base function  [   N   i   ]  is divided into the boundary displacements set  [   u   B   s   ]  and the internal displacements set  [   u   I   s   ]  .  The internal DOFs of the coarse element with the eight given boundary conditions are solved by  (27)   [   u   B   s   ] = [ T ] ,  [   u   I   s   ] = \u2212   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] [ T ] .       The numerical base function [41] of coarse element is defined by  (28)   [   N   1      N   2     \u22ef    N   8   ] =  [        u   B   s           u   I   s        ]  = [ G ] [   u   E   s   ] ,    where  [   u   E   s   ]  is the nodal DOFs of the coarse element, and  [   u   E   s   ] =   [ I ]   8 \u00d7 8    with the linear boundary conditions.  The specific expression of the numerical base function can be obtained by all the solutions of the subproblem as follows:  (29)   [ G ] =  [      [ T ]       \u2212   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] [ T ]      ]  .       Once the base function is constructed, the equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of the coarse element s can be derived as follows:  (30)   [   K   E   s   ] =   [ G ]  T   [        K   B B   s         K   B I   s           K   I B   s         K   I I   s        ]  [ G ] =   [ T ]  T  [   K   B B   s   ] [ T ] \u2212   [ T ]  T  [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [   K   I B   s   ] [ T ] ,       (31)   {   F   E   s   } =   [ G ]  T   {        F   B   s           F   I   s        }  =   [ T ]  T  {   F   B   s   } \u2212   [ T ]  T  [   K   B I   s   ]   [   K   I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   {   F   I   s   } .       The results demonstrate that the proposed method with the bilinear quadrilateral base functions and the EMsFEM with the linear boundary condition bear the consistency. In this paper, the proposed method is equivalent to construct a boundary value problem to attain the numerical base functions in the coarse element domain. However, the base function of the coarse grid is obtained numerically with the EMsFEM which is difficult to provide the form of complicated boundary conditions explicitly. Dissimilarly, the proposed method which employs nonlinear base functions in the coarse element domain based on substructural boundary assumption can construct various boundary conditions conveniently and flexibly through the transformation matrix, especially the excellent higher-order base functions which are essential for the two-level beam and plate problems. Furthermore, this proposed method can be easily extended into heterogeneous materials, dynamic analysis, elasto-plastic analysis and thermoelastic analysis by referring to the EMsFEM. Moreover, the advantages of this method include the flexible downscaling procedure, the convenient fine-scale calculation of the strain and stress, no periodic and scale-separation assumption which can implement the coupling analysis with the substructure method and the traditional FEM in a uniform framework and deal with the complicated problem.  For the plane problems, several approaches can be selected to construct higher-order boundary conditions and improve the accuracy of the calculation. Firstly, the DOFs can be added at each node of coarse grids, such as the rotational membrane element [48] with the additional in-plane drilling DOF. Secondly, the DOFs are possible to be supplemented in the interior of coarse grids, such as the Wilson nonconforming element. Thirdly, the boundary node of coarse grids can be appended as the additional DOFs, such as the serendipity element or the multi-node piecewise linear element.  If the base functions of eight-node serendipity element are employed as the interpolation functions for the displacements of coarse grids, the transformation matrix is  (32)   [ T ] =  [      N (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03b7   1   )       N (   \u03be   2   ,   \u03b7   2   )      \u22ee      N (   \u03be   p   ,   \u03b7   p   )      ]  ,    where the subscript p means the number of the boundary nodes  (33)   [ N ( \u03be , \u03b7 ) ] =  [        N   1      0      N   2      0     0      N   1      0      N   2         \u22ef        N   8      0     0      N   8        ]  ,       (34)     N   5   =  1 2  ( 1 \u2212   \u03be  2  ) ( 1 \u2212 \u03b7 ) ,    N   6   =  1 2  ( 1 \u2212   \u03b7  2  ) ( 1 + \u03be ) ,   N   7   =  1 2  ( 1 \u2212   \u03be  2  ) ( 1 + \u03b7 ) ,    N   8   =  1 2  ( 1 \u2212   \u03b7  2  ) ( 1 \u2212 \u03be ) ,   N   1   =    N ^    1   \u2212  1 2    N   5   \u2212  1 2    N   8   ,    N   2   =    N ^    2   \u2212  1 2    N   5   \u2212  1 2    N   6   ,   N   3   =    N ^    3   \u2212  1 2    N   6   \u2212  1 2    N   7   ,    N   4   =    N ^    4   \u2212  1 2    N   7   \u2212  1 2    N   8   .       With regards to the multilayered plate structures, two kinds of boundary conditions should be considered including the in-plane (horizontal) direction and the thickness (vertical) direction. The in-plane boundary conditions can be obtained by the above methods in Section 4.1. Furthermore, the base functions through the thickness direction are also need to be assumed by different plate theories. However, for the multilayered beam problems, only the boundary conditions through the thickness direction are need to be constructed. We propose several higher-order boundary conditions by referring to corresponding laminated theories.  \u2022 First-order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) [49]   Based on the Classical Lamination Theory (CLT), the FSDT relaxes the Kirchhoff assumption and shows the importance of the transverse shear effect for the prediction of deflections and in-plane displacements which are assumed to be linear across the thickness of the plate. The corresponding displacements are  (35)   u ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   x   ( x , y ) v ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   y   ( x , y ) w ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y ) .       The base function of the coarse element is  (36)   { u } =  [  N ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z )  ]  {   u   E   s   } .       If the in-plane boundary conditions use the base functions of the bilinear quadrilateral element, the interpolation functions for nodal DOFs of the coarse element s are written as  (37)     u   0   ( x , y ) =  \u2211  q = 1  4      N ^    q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    u   0 q   s   ,    \u03d5   x   ( x , y ) =  \u2211  q = 1  4      N ^    q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    \u03d5   x q   s   ,    v   0   ( x , y ) =  \u2211  q = 1  4      N ^    q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    v   0 q   s   ,   \u03d5   y   ( x , y ) =  \u2211  q = 1  4      N ^    q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    \u03d5   y q   s   ,    w   0   ( x , y ) =  \u2211  q = 1  4      N ^    q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 )    w   0 q   s   ,    where the subscript q means the number of the nodes of the coarse element s   (38)   [ N ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z ) ] =  [        N   1   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z )       N   2   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z )       N   3   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z )       N   4   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z )      ]  ,       (39)   [   N   4   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z ) ] =  [         N ^    4       z    N ^    4      0   0   0     0   0       N ^    4       z    N ^    4      0     0   0   0   0       N ^    4        ]  ,       (40)   {   u   E   s   } =   [   {   u   E 1   s   }  T     {   u   E 2   s   }  T     {   u   E 3   s   }  T     {   u   E 4   s   }  T  ]  T  ,       (41)   {   u   E 4   s   } =   [       u   04   s         \u03d5   x 4   s         v   04   s         \u03d5   y 4   s         w   04   s       ]  T  .       \u2022 Reddy Higher-order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT-Reddy) [50]   In order to overcome the limitation of the CLT and FSDT, many improving higher-order shear deformation theories were proposed which separate the in-plane variables and the thickness coordinate. The Reddy\u05f3s theory is one of the most representative which has the third-order expressions applied by the free surface condition with the zero transverse shear stress. The corresponding displacements are  (42)   u ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) \u2212  (    \u2202   w   0   ( x , y )   \u2202 x   \u2212   \u03b3   x   ( x , y )  )  z \u2212   4   z  3    3   h  2      \u03b3   x   ( x , y ) v ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) \u2212  (    \u2202   w   0   ( x , y )   \u2202 y   \u2212   \u03b3   y   ( x , y )  )  z \u2212   4   z  3    3   h  2      \u03b3   y   ( x , y ) w ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y ) .       The base function of the coarse element is  (43)   [   N   q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z ) ] =  [        N   q       \u2212 z   N   q        (  z \u2212 4   z  3  / 3   h  2   )    N   q      0   0   0   0     0   0   0      N   q       \u2212 z   N   q        (  z \u2212 4   z  3  / 3   h  2   )    N   q      0     0   0   0   0   0   0      N   q        ]  .    where the subscript q means the number of the nodes of the coarse element s.  Kant [51] or Matsunaga [52] Higher-order Shear Deformation Theory (HSDT-mn)  In addition, the in-plane displacements and deflection were expanded into the polynomial series by the Kant and Matsunaga higher-order theories which have different expressions with different orders of the expanded series. The corresponding displacements are  (44)   u ( x , y , z ) =  \u2211  i = 0  m     z  i    u   i   ( x , y )  v ( x , y , z ) =  \u2211  i = 0  m     z  i    v   i   ( x , y )  w ( x , y , z ) =  \u2211  i = 0  n     z  i    w   i   ( x , y )  .       The base function of the coarse element is  (45)   [   N   q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z ) ] =  [        N   q      \u22ef      z  m    N   q      0   \u22ef   0   0   \u22ef   0     0   \u22ef   0      N   q      \u22ef      z  m    N   q      0   \u22ef   0     0   \u22ef   0   0   \u22ef   0      N   q      \u22ef      z  n    N   q        ]  .       Global\u2013local Higher-order Shear Deformation Theory  Subsequently, several researchers [53\u201355] proposed global\u2013local higher-order theories which divide the in-plane displacements into two parts. The global part selects the FSDT and HSDT, and the local part describes features of the local displacements. For laminated structures, a local function called zigzag function is presented by Murakami [56] which can describe the in-plane displacement variation along the thickness direction more objectively. Because it is not a very good description of the in-plane displacement variation along the thickness direction to improve the order of the expressions simply. The corresponding displacements are  (46)   u ( x , y , z ) =   u   G   ( x , y , z ) +   u   L   ( x , y , z ) v ( x , y , z ) =   v   G   ( x , y , z ) +   v   L   ( x , y , z ) w ( x , y , z ) =   w   G   ( x , y , z ) ,    where the global displacements can be written as  (47)     u   G   ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   x   ( x , y )   v   G   ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   y   ( x , y )   w   G   ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y ) ,    and the local displacements are as follows:  (48)     u   L   ( x , y , z ) = M ( z )   u   M   ( x , y )   v   L   ( x , y , z ) = M ( z )   u   M   ( x , y ) ,       (49)   M ( z ) =   ( \u2212 1 )  k    \u03b6   k   ,           \u03b6   k   is the local coordinate of the kth layer, and  \u2212 1 \u2264   \u03b6   k   \u2264 1  .  The base function of the coarse element is  (50)   [   N   q   ( \u03be , \u03b7 , z ) ] =  [        N   q       z   N   q       M ( z )   N   q      0   0   0   0     0   0   0      N   q       z   N   q       M ( z )   N   q      0     0   0   0   0   0   0      N   q        ]  .       The transformation matrix of the coarse element which can be constructed by different theories is  (51)   [ T ] =  [      N (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03b7   1   ,   z   1   )       N (   \u03be   2   ,   \u03b7   2   ,   z   2   )      \u22ee      N (   \u03be   p   ,   \u03b7   p   ,   z   p   )      ]  ,    where the subscript q means the number of the nodes of the coarse element, p is the number of boundary nodes.  In the dynamic response analysis, the dynamic equation of the structure can be transformed into an equivalent static equilibrium equation uniformly in each time step by different time integration algorithms and their assumptions. The upscaling procedure can be used to deal with the equivalent static equilibrium equation and solve the coarse-scale issue. In each time step, the velocity and acceleration are updated by the downscaling procedure. In view of different time integration algorithms, such as Newmark method, Wilson-\u03b8 method, central difference method and Bathe method [57], the equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of a coarse element are different. In this paper, Bathe method is used for the two-level analysis of the dynamic response because of its better accuracy and stability.  The equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of the substructure s can be accumulated by fine grids in the kth time step. The equivalent stiffness matrix is consist of the stiffness matrix, the mass matrix and damping matrix of the fine element e. Besides, the equivalent load vector is consist of the stiffness matrix, the mass matrix and damping matrix of the fine element e and the displacement, the velocity and acceleration of the last time step. In the first sub-step, they can be written as  (52)   [    K ^    1   s   ] =  \u2211  e = 1     q   s      ( [   K  e  ] +   a   0   [   M  e  ] +   a   1   [   C  e  ] )  ,       (53)     {    F ^    1   s   }   k + \u03b3   =  \u2211  e = 1     q   s     (   {   F  e  }   k + \u03b3   + [   M  e  ] (   a   0     {   u  e  }  k  + 2   a   1     {    u \u0307   e  }  k  +   {    u \u00a8   e  }  k  ) + [   C  e  ] (   a   1     {   u  e  }  k  +   {    u \u0307   e  }  k  ) ) ,    and in the second sub-step they are as follows:  (54)   [    K ^    2   s   ] =  \u2211  e = 1     q   s      ( [   K  e  ] +   a   4   2   [   M  e  ] +   a   4   [   C  e  ] )  ,       (55)     {    F ^    2   s   }   k + 1   =  \u2211  e = 1     q   s     (   {   F  e  }   k + 1   \u2212 [   M  e  ] (   a   2     {    u \u0307   e  }  k  +   a   3     {    u \u0307   e  }   k + \u03b3   +   a   2     a   4     {   u  e  }  k  +   a   3     a   4     {   u  e  }   k + \u03b3   ) \u2212 [   C  e  ] (   a   2     {   u  e  }  k  +   a   3     {   u  e  }   k + \u03b3   ) ) ,    where the integral constants are introduced in Ref. [57].  [   K  e  ]  is the stiffness matrix of the fine element e;  [   M  e  ]  is the mass matrix of the fine element e;  [   C  e  ]  is the damping matrix of the fine element e;   q   s   is the count of fine elements in the substructure s; k is the time step of the transient analysis.  Particularly,  [    K ^    1   s   ] = [    K ^    2   s   ]  , when the value of algorithm parameter  \u03b3 = 2 \u2212  2   . Then only one factorization of an effective stiffness matrix is required. Using Eqs. (1)\u2013(17), the equivalent stiffness matrix and load vector of the coarse element s can be obtained as  (56)   [    K ^    1 , E   s   ] = [    K ^    2 , E   s   ] =   [ T ]  T  [    K ^    1 , B B   s   ] [ T ] \u2212   [ T ]  T  [    K ^    1 , B I   s   ]   [    K ^    1 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [    K ^    1 , I B   s   ] [ T ] ,       (57)     {    F ^    1 , E   s   }   k + \u03b3   =   [ T ]  T    {    F ^    1 , B   s   }   k + \u03b3   \u2212   [ T ]  T  [    K ^    1 , B I   s   ]   [    K ^    1 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1     {    F ^    1 , I   s   }   k + \u03b3   ,       (58)     {    F ^    2 , E   s   }   k + 1   =   [ T ]  T    {    F ^    2 , B   s   }   k + 1   \u2212   [ T ]  T  [    K ^    1 , B I   s   ]   [    K ^    1 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1     {    F ^    2 , I   s   }   k + 1   .       The coarse-scale problem can be solved by Eqs. (18)\u2013(20) in the first sub-step.  (59)   [    K ^    1   *   ] =  A  s = 1  M  [    K ^    1 , E   s   ] ,    {    F ^    1   *   }   k + \u03b3   =  A  s = 1  M    {    F ^    1 , E   s   }   k + \u03b3   ,  [    K ^    1   *   ]   {   u  *  }   k + \u03b3   =   {    F ^    1   *   }   k + \u03b3   .       The displacements of fine elements in this time step can be attained by the downscaling procedure. Afterwards, the velocity and acceleration are updated by the Bathe method [57] for the next time step iteration.  (60)     {   u   I   s   }   k + \u03b3   =   [    K ^    1 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1     {    F ^    1 , I   s   }   k + \u03b3   \u2212   [    K ^    1 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [    K ^    1 , I B   s   ] [ T ]   {   u   E   s   }   k + \u03b3   .       In the second sub-step, only the equivalent load vector need to be assembled.  (61)   [    K ^    2   *   ] = [    K ^    1   *   ] ,    {    F ^    2   *   }   k + 1   =  A  s = 1  M    {    F ^    2 , E   s   }   k + 1   ,  [    K ^    2   *   ]   {   u  *  }   k + 1   =   {    F ^    2   *   }   k + 1   .       Similarly, the displacements of fine elements in this time step can be attained by the downscaling procedure and the velocity and acceleration are updated by the Bathe method.  (62)     {   u   I   s   }   k + 1   =   [    K ^    2 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1     {    F ^    2 I   s   }   k + 1   \u2212   [    K ^    2 , I I   s   ]   \u2212 1   [    K ^    2 , I B   s   ] [ T ]   {   u   E   s   }   k + 1   .       In the next time step, the assembled procedure of the equivalent load vector and the downscaling procedure should be implemented until the analysis is complete.  Firstly, the error and convergence analysis of the proposed method is discussed in this section. A homogeneous cantilever beam with the length of 18m and the height of 6m is considered. The elastic modulus and Poisson\u05f3s ratio of the material are 200GPa and 0.3, respectively. The left side of the beam is fixed and a concentrated force of 1000N is applied at the bottom right corner. The effect of mesh refinement on the method is shown in Fig. 4. The relation between the element count and the minimum displacement is described in two convergence plots. The effect is shown in Fig. 4(a) if the fine scale is refined but the coarse scale is not. However, the effect is shown in Fig. 4(b) if the coarse scale is refined but the fine scale is not.  In order to examine the convergence of different coarse elements in the two-level analysis, three base functions, including the rotational membrane element, the Wilson nonconforming element, the 8-node serendipity element, are selected to compare with EMsFEM with the linear boundary condition. The reference is solved by the traditional FEM with 43,200 elements and 43,681 nodes. Along with the increase of the fine or coarse elements, the minimum displacements of different coarse elements are close to that of the reference. Moreover, the results of the proposed method with higher-order coarse elements have a higher accuracy. It is shown that the proposed method which employs nonlinear base functions in the coarse element domain based on substructural boundary assumption is effective and advantageous.  Another example is a inhomogeneous cantilever beam which has 30 plane coarse elements with the thickness of 0.001m and 2520 fine elements with 2861 nodes. The end of the model which is shown in Fig. 5 is applied by the uniform shear force with 1N/m. The material is steel with the parameters shown in Table 1.  In order to examine the accuracy of different coarse elements in the two-level analysis, five base functions, including the rotational membrane element, the Wilson nonconforming element, the 8-node piecewise linear element, the 8-node and 12-node serendipity element, are selected to compare with the traditional FEM, substructure method and EMsFEM with the linear boundary condition.  The comparisons of displacement results with different methods are written in Table 2. It can be seen that the substructure method and the traditional FEM have the same precision. The proposed method has a higher precision than EMsFEM with the linear boundary condition, and the accuracy of the 8-node serendipity coarse element is better than the 8-node piecewise linear coarse element. Moreover, the top issue of the substructure method has a large number of external DOFs, while the DOFs of the coarse problem in the proposed two-level method are much less. The deflections of the central line are shown in Fig. 6. It shows that the results of the proposed method are almost the same as that of the traditional FEM and the coarse element with the 12-node serendipity base functions has the highest precision among them, because the higher-order base functions have a higher precision than the common base functions in the coarse grids.  The examined model shown in Fig. 7 is a sandwich beam with three layers which has 10 coarse elements with the thickness of 0.01m and 23,440 fine elements with 13,129 nodes. The length and height of the beam are 1m and 0.12m respectively, which is applied by the uniform pressure with 4000N/m in the middle domain. Two constraint conditions are considered including the simply supported constraint and the fixed constraint at both ends. The material of the surface is aluminum and the materials of the core layer are aluminum and epoxy with the parameters shown in Table 1.  In order to examine the accuracy of different laminated theories in the two-level analysis, four base functions are selected to compare with the traditional FEM and the substructure method including FSDT, HSDT-Reddy, HSDT-76 and the global\u2013local higher-order theory. The global base functions are selected by Reddy\u05f3s theory as follows:  (63)     u   G   ( x , z ) =   u   0   ( x ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   0   ( x )   \u2202 x   +  (  z \u2212   4   z  3    3   h  2     )    \u03b3   x   ( x )   w   G   ( x , z ) =   w   0   ( x ) + z   w   1   ( x ) +   z  2    w   2   ( x ) ,    and the local base function is described by sine series which can be written as  (64)    u L  ( x , z ) =  sin  (   2 \u03c0 z   h c   )   u  L 1   ( x ) +  sin  (   4 \u03c0 z   h c   )   u  L 2   ( x ) ,    where   h   c   is the half thickness of the core layer.  The boundary displacements of the coarse element are actually the piecewise linear expression of the base functions of Reddy\u05f3s theory between the nodes of fine element edges. The rotational DOF of the coarse element describes the angle of the beam section. However, the fine element has only displacement DOFs without the rotational DOF. The angle of the beam section in the fine element is represented by a differential form. The displacement generated by the rotation can be defined as  (65)     u   R   ( x , z ) =   u   G   ( x , z ) \u2212   u   0   ( x ) +   4   z  3    3   h  2      \u03b3   x   ( x ) .       The rotational displacements of node p and node p+1 on the boundary of the coarse element are written as  (66)     u   R   ( x ,   z   p   ) =   \u03b8   x   ( x )   z   p   ,    u   R   ( x ,   z   p + 1   ) =   \u03b8   x   ( x )   z   p + 1   ,    where,  (67)     \u03b8   x   ( x ) =   \u03b3   x   ( x ) \u2212   \u2202   w   0   ( x )   \u2202 x   .       The rotational displacement between two nodes of the fine element edge is obtained by the linear interpolation such that  (68)    u R  ( x ,  z p  + \u0394 z ) =    z  p + 1   \u2212  z p  \u2212 \u0394 z    z  p + 1   \u2212  z p     u R  ( x ,  z p  ) +   \u0394 z    z  p + 1   \u2212  z p     u R  ( x ,  z  p + 1   ) .       The rotations continuity between fine and coarse elements is enforce such that  (69)    \u03b8  x , \u0394 z   ( x ) =    u R  ( x ,  z p  + \u0394 z ) \u2212  u R  ( x ,  z p  )   \u0394 z   =  \u03b8 x  ( x ) .       Therefore, each coarse grid has more fine elements, the boundary displacements of the coarse element are more close to the base functions of Reddy\u05f3s theory.  The comparisons of displacement results of different coarse elements with the simply supported constraint and the fixed constraint are written in  Tables 3 and 4. The results demonstrate that the substructure method and the traditional FEM have the same precision, and the proposed two-level method has less external DOFs with a relatively high accuracy. The coarse element using the global\u2013local higher-order theory has the highest precision among them in both constraint conditions although the coarse element with HSDT-76 has more DOFs, because the global\u2013local higher-order theory can describe the in-plane displacement variation along the thickness direction more objectively. Moreover, the Mises stress results with the simply supported constraint of the traditional FEM and the proposed method using the global\u2013local coarse element are shown in  Figs. 8 and 9. The Mises stress results of two methods draw the similar conclusions. Especially, the stress concentration around the hole and the maximum or interfacial stress are also captured well. In conclusion, although the proposed method solves the final problem at the macroscopical level, almost identical accuracy as the direct solution could be obtained, which is mainly because the fine properties of excellent boundary conditions.  The in-plane displacement and Mises stress of the beam section are shown in Fig. 10 with different methods in the case of the fixed constraint. The results of the beam section which is in the interior of the coarse element (Fig. 10(a),(b)) are described well by most methods. However, the results of the beam section which is in the boundary of the coarse element (Fig. 10(c),(d)) are described better by the global\u2013local higher-order theory.  The examined model shown in Fig. 11 is a multilayered cantilever beam with four layers which has 20 coarse elements with the thickness of 0.01m and 24,160 fine elements with 12,433 nodes. The length and height of the beam are 1.6m and 0.16m respectively, which is applied by the uniform pressure with 200N/m at the surface of the free end. Four layers contain the aluminum layer and the epoxy layer with the carbon fiber inclusion alternately. The corresponding material parameters are shown in Table 1.  The base functions with the global\u2013local higher-order theory are selected to compare with the traditional FEM. The coarse problem has 105 DOFs in the proposed method with 5 DOFs in each node of the coarse element which has 1386 DOFs in the substructure method. The global base functions are selected by Reddy\u05f3s theory as follows:  (70)     u   G   ( x , z ) =   u   0   ( x ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   0   ( x )   \u2202 x   +  (  z \u2212   4   z  3    3   h  2     )    \u03b3   x   ( x )   w   G   ( x , z ) =   w   0   ( x ) ,    and the local base function is described by zigzag function which can be written as  (71)     u   L   ( x , z ) = M ( z )   u   M   ( x ) .       According to the proposed method and the traditional FEM, the deflection and Mises stress of the coarse element with the downscaling procedure are shown in  Figs. 12 and 13. It can be seen that the results of both coarse-scale and fine-scale issue are fairly consistent. Although, the Mises stress contours have a little difference because of the boundary constraint condition in two sides, the maximum stress and interfacial stress of different materials are still captured well.  The examined model is a lattice structure with three layers shown in Fig. 14 which has 100 coarse plate elements and 82,596 fine elements with 127,386 nodes. The length and height of the plate are 0.7m and 0.12m respectively, which is applied by the fixed constraint with two sides and the uniform pressure with 0.04MPa on the surface. The material of the surface is aluminum and the material of the supporting column is carbon fiber with the parameters shown in Table 1.  In order to examine the accuracy of different laminated theories in the two-level analysis, four base functions are selected to compare with the traditional FEM and the substructure method including FSDT, HSDT-Reddy, HSDT-54 and the global\u2013local higher-order theory. The global base functions are selected by FSDT as follows:  (72)     u   G   ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   x   ( x , y )   v   G   ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) + z   \u03d5   y   ( x , y )   w   G   ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y ) ,    and the local base functions are described by zigzag function which can be written as  (73)     u   L   ( x , y , z ) = M ( z )   u   M   ( x , y )   v   L   ( x , y , z ) = M ( z )   u   M   ( x , y ) .       The comparisons of central displacement results of one side with different coarse elements are shown in Fig. 15. The DOFs of the coarse problem and the computational time are written in Table 5. In this paper, MATLAB with the sparse algorithm and Xeon E5650 CPU with 36GB memory are used for the computation with one-core. The results show that the coarse elements of the HSDT-54 and global\u2013local higher-order theory have a higher accuracy which are different with the FSDT and HSDT-Reddy. However, the global\u2013local theory costs less computational time with a small-size coarse problem. The two-level analysis has a higher efficiency than the traditional FEM and the substructure method.  Four feature unit cells are examined and shown in Fig. 16 with the downscaling procedure. The Mises stress results of the proposed method using the global\u2013local coarse element and the traditional FEM are shown in Fig. 17. The maximum Mises stress of fine grids occurs in the unit cell of A. It can be seen that the Mises stress contours and the maximum stress of the coarse element with the global\u2013local higher-order theory are quite coincident with the traditional FEM.  In the dynamic problem, the above model is also discussed and the uniform pressure is related to time which is assumed as  P ( t ) =  sin ( 2 \u03c0 f t )  , where f equals 20Hz. The Bathe method is used as the time integration algorithm with a parameter of  \u03b3 = 2 \u2212  2   . The analysis time and the time step are 0.1s and 0.001s respectively. The Rayleigh damping model of  [   C  e  ] = \u03b1 [   M  e  ] + \u03b2 [   K  e  ]  is used with the parameters  \u03b1 = 0.2  and  \u03b2 = 0.001  . The proposed method with the global\u2013local higher-order theory is selected to compare with the traditional FEM.  Considering the proposed method and the traditional FEM, the displacement, velocity and acceleration of the free corner on the surface with the downscaling procedure are shown in   Figs. 18\u201320. The traditional FEM costs 177.0min and 5.93GB of memory, but the proposed method only costs 20.9min and 0.35GB of memory. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the response results of both two methods are fairly consistent.  The Mises stress results with no damping of two time points in the proposed method and the traditional FEM are shown in  Figs. 21 and 22. It illustrates that the Mises stress of the coarse element with the global\u2013local higher-order theory is also quite coincident with the traditional FEM in the dynamic problem.   CONCLUSIONS   In this paper, a new computationally efficient method is proposed to construct complicated and higher-order boundary conditions based on the substructural boundary assumption, which describes the boundary of coarse grids with a concept of the transformation matrix uniformly and applies the downscaling computation easily. The proposed method of the bilinear quadrilateral base functions possesses the consistency with the EMsFEM of the linear boundary condition. However, the proposed method can construct various boundary conditions flexibly by different transformation matrices and implement the coupling analysis with the substructure method and the traditional FEM in a uniform framework. In the dynamic analysis, the proposed method can be simply implemented by several time integration algorithms. With regards to the multilayered composite plate problem, both two kinds of boundary conditions including in-plane and the thickness direction need to be constructed by different laminated theories. In the numerical tests, the proposed method with the global\u2013local higher-order coarse element has a higher precision of fine grids with less DOFs of the coarse problem, which costs less computation time and memory than the traditional FEM in both static and dynamic analysis.
