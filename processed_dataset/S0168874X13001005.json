A refined 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element is given out, and the element captures the scale effect and has high accuracy.      The element can pass the C0\u20131 patch test.      Refined method can improve the accuracy of the triangular element by changing one parameter.      Stresses smooth technique can improve the accuracy of stress accuracy.          KEYPHRASES   Couple stress theory  Triangular hybrid stress element  Enhanced patch test  Scale effect   With the material size scaling down to the order of micro-scales, numerous experiments conducted in the past decades demonstrated strong size effects. For example, Fleck et al. [1] discovered that the scaled shear strength increases by a factor of three as the wire diameter decreases from 170 to 12\u03bcm in torsion experiments on copper wires. Similar phenomena were observed in micro-indentation test [2] and micro-bend test [3]. These phenomena are commonly referred to as size or scale effects. The above observations indicate that the classical continuum mechanics may not be valid at the micro-scale, which leads to the theories for microstructures needed to be developed. The couple stress theory is one of the theories for microstructures.  A series of research in the couple stress/strain gradient theories have been made. For example, Toupin [4], Koiter [5] and Mindlin [6] proposed couple stress theory; Fleck-Hutchinson [7] proposed couple stress theory containing one material\u2019s characteristic length constants; Yang [8] proposed symmetrical couple stress containing one of the material characteristic length constants.  The C1 continuity thin plate elements in the conventional finite element method, such as the 18-DOF and 21-DOF triangular thin plate element functions proposed by Argyris et al. [9] and Bell [10], can satisfy the continuity conditions of displacements and their first derivatives simultaneously. However, node parameters of the element are more than the first derivatives of the displacement, it is difficult in engineering application to satisfy the boundary conditions. In the application of engineering the C1 continuity plate elements using lower order node parameters, mostly based on weak continuity, are only required to satisfy the weak C1 continuity condition. Therefore, new subjects on finite element method in couple stress/strain gradient theory arise: C1 weak continuity element, which requires element function satisfying both weak C0 continuity with second-order accuracy and weak C1 continuity simultaneously. However, it is difficult to satisfy these requirements by the conventional finite element method.  Zervos [11] analyzed the scale effect by using C1 continuity fourth-order accuracy 18-DOF triangular plate element function, where each node contains six displacement parameters with higher derivatives. Papanicolopulos and Zervos [12,13] established third-order accuracy 3D hexahedral element function with 64 parameters, where each node contains eight displacement parameters with higher order derivatives. The method can be applied directly to the couple stress/strain gradient theory to establish four-node plane elements, satisfying both C0 and C1 continuities. However, such elements are not suitable to apply in engineering because it is difficult to satisfy the boundary conditions due to higher order derivatives of node parameters. The C1 continuity elements with higher order derivatives of node parameters are rarely applied in engineering. Zervos\u2019s articles are a few literatures on the C1 continuity element which can be searched up to now.  New subject is how to establish C1 continuity element by using lower order node parameters. It is well known that the difficulty to establish the C1 continuity thin plate element in traditional continuum mechanics is solved by using weak C1 continuity conditions instead of C1 continuity. However, the weak C1 continuity condition of couple stress/strain gradient finite element requires to satisfy not only weak C1 continuity but also C0 continuity (or weak C0 continuity) with second-order accuracy. Recently Chen et al. proposed several refined nonconforming elements satisfying weak C1 continuity and weak C0 continuity with second-order accuracy, such as the weak C1 continuity 18-DOF plane couple stress triangular element [14], 18-DOF axisymmetric couple stress triangular element [15] and 24-DOF plane couple stress quadrilateral element [16] in which node parameters contain only displacements and their first derivatives. Patch test is widely used to check the convergence of nonconforming elements. Chen and Soh [17,18] proposed the C0\u20131 patch test(or enhanced patch test) for couple stress/strain gradient elasticity. The test displacement functions for the C0\u20131 patch test should be quadratic polynomials, i.e.  u =   a   1   +   a   2   x +   a   3   y +   a   4     x  2  + a  x    5   y +   a   6     y  2  and v =   b   1   +   b   2   x +   b   3   y +   b   4     x  2  + b  x    5   y +   b   6     y  2  where   a   i   and   b   i   are constants. The test functions should satisfy equilibrium equations without body force. Up to now, the elements proposed by Zervos and by Chen et al. are the only one that can pass the enhanced patch test.  Based on a modified complementary energy principle, the assumed stress hybrid finite element proposed by Pian [19] can avoid the difficulty of forming the displacement field interpolation functions while using the displacement conforming element under the condition of the continuous field variables and their first-derivative.  Several methods for deriving assumed stress fields [20] have been proposed. Pian and Sumihara [21] proposed a new quadrilateral hybrid stress element that is based on the Hellinger\u2013Reissner principle. They defined the assumed stresses in the natural coordinate system. The stresses are in-turn initially defined in the form of complete uncoupled polynomials. Equilibrium conditions are then enforced on them through integral-type equations with geometric perturbation and subsequently degenerated to rational stress terms. Tong [22] proposed displacement hybrid finite element model, and Chen [23,24] proposed generalized hybrid element model and refined hybrid element model by using the H\u2013W variational principle.  Sze [25] used orthogonal lower- and higher-order stress modes to construct a hybrid stress element. His approach allows the partition of the element stiffness matrix into a lower- and a higher-order stiffness matrix. When the lower-order stiffness turns out to be identical to the sub-integrated element, the higher-order stiffness matrix plays the role of a stabilization matrix.  For displacement element on the couple stress theory, it is hard to choose displacement function under the condition of satisfying both C0 and C1 continuities in the weak form. However, hybrid stress element for the couple stress theory only requires that the element stress interpolation functions satisfied the equilibrium equations and boundary displacement interpolation functions have high enough order.  Displacement: { u ,  v ,    u   x   ,    u   y   ,    v   x   ,    v   y   }, where u ,  v are displacements along x and y directions,   u   x   ,    u   y   ,    v   x   ,    v   y   are the first derivatives of the displacement variables.  The geometric equations can be written as  (1)  {        \u03b5   x   =   \u2202 u   \u2202 x           \u03b5   y   =   \u2202 v   \u2202 y           \u03b3   s   =   \u2202 v   \u2202 x   +   \u2202 u   \u2202 y           \u03c7   x   =   \u2202 \u03c9   \u2202 x   =  1 2   (      \u2202  2  u   \u2202 x \u2202 y   \u2212     \u2202  2  v   \u2202   x  2     )          \u03c7   y   =   \u2202 \u03c9   \u2202 y   =  1 2   (      \u2202  2  u   \u2202   y  2    \u2212     \u2202  2  v   \u2202 x \u2202 y    )         where \u03c9 =  1 2   (    \u2202 u   \u2202 y   \u2212   \u2202 v   \u2202 x    )     Strain: {   \u03b5   x   ,    \u03b5   y   ,    \u03b3   s   ,    \u03c7   x   ,    \u03c7   y   } .

The strain energy can be expressed as  (2)  U =  \u222b V   ( (   \u03c3   x     \u03b5   x   +   \u03c3   y     \u03b5   y   +   \u03c4   s     \u03b3   s   ) + (   m   x     \u03c7   x   +   m   y     \u03c7   y   ) )  d V       Substituting Eq.

The prescribed displacement  u \u00af  on the boundary is written as  (14)   u \u00af  = Lq   where L are interpolation functions, q are node displacements parameters.  By using Eqs. (9) and (12), the total complementary energy is written as  (15)    \u03c0   e   =   1 2     \u03b2   a   T     H   1     \u03b2   a   +   1 2     \u03b2   c   T     H   2     \u03b2   c   \u2212   \u03b2   a   T   Gq \u2212   \u03b2   c   T   Gq   where  (16)  G =  \u222b  \u2202 \u03a9      ( RP )  T  L  d s       By \u2202   \u03c0   e   / \u2202   \u03b2   i   = 0  ( i = 1.. . m ) , we can yield  (17)   [        H   1             H   2        ]   [        \u03b2   a           \u03b2   c        ]  = Gq   and  (18)   [       \u03b2   a         \u03b2   c       ]  =   [        H   1             H   2        ]   \u2212 1   Gq      Substituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (12), one obtains  (19)  U =  1 2    q  T    G  T    [        H   1             H   2        ]   \u2212 1   Gq      By comparison with U = ( 1 / 2 )   q  T  Kq , one can conclude the element stiffness matrix  (20)  K =   G  T    [        H   1             H   2        ]   \u2212 1   G      Substituting Eq. (18) into Eq. (10), the stress distribution can be expressed as follows:  (21)    {        \u03c3   a   =   P   1     \u03b2   a   =   P   1      H   1    \u2212 1   Gq ,         \u03c3   c   =   P   2     \u03b2   c   =   P   2      H   2    \u2212 1   Gq .             Moreover, the necessary condition for the element avoiding the spurious zero energy modes is that the rank of the element stiffness matrix may satisfy  (22)  r a n k ( K ) = n \u2212 r   where n is the total number of nodal displacements, and r is the number of rigid-body modes in an element.  From Eqs. (21) and (22), one can obtain m as the number of independent \u03b2    (23)  m \u2265 n \u2212 r ,  m = r a n k ( H ) ,  r a n k ( K ) = r a n k ( G ) ,    in which   H =  [        H   1             H   2        ]    is the full rank matrix.  The ranks of matrix G and H are all depended on the number of the assumed stress coefficients \u03b2 . Each extra term may increase the unwanted element rigidity on the contrary and overuse of stress modes will also cost more computational time because the calculation of element stiffness matrix requires inversion of the flexibility matrix whose rank is equal to the number of stress modes. Therefore, least-order stress modes are considered to be optimal with respect to efficiency.  Based on the plane couple stress theory and hybrid stress element method, as shown in Fig. 1, the formulation of 18-DOF couple stress hybrid stress element is proposed. Six degrees of freedom are used at each node in the element.  The stress \u03c3 of the 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element for couple stress theory is assumed as follows:   \u03c3 =   {   \u03c3   x   ,   \u03c3   y   ,   \u03c4   s   ,   m   x   ,   m   y   }  T  = P \u03b2      (24)  P =  [        P   1             P   2        ]       The couple stress part can be expressed by 6 \u03b2  i.e.      P   2   =  [     1   x   y       1   x   y     ]  ,      and conventional stress part   P   1   can be expressed by the Airy stress function with 15 \u03b2 ( Table 1).  It should be noted that the stress distribution \u03c3 should satisfy the equilibrium Eq. (5) and Airy stress function satisfies the condition.  The boundary force T can be expressed as  (25)  T = R  [        P   1             P   2        ]   [       \u03b2   a         \u03b2   c       ]    in which the matrix R can be derived from the boundary forces (4) as follows:   T =  {        T   x           T   y           T   \u03c9        }  =  [        \u03c3   x     n   x   +   \u03c4   s     n   y   \u2212  1 2   (    \u2202   m   x     \u2202 x   +   \u2202   m   y     \u2202 y    )    n   y           \u03c3   y     n   y   +   \u03c4   s     n   x   +  1 2   (    \u2202   m   x     \u2202 x   +   \u2202   m   y     \u2202 y    )    n   x           m   x     n   x   +   m   y     n   y        ]  =  [        n   x      0      n   y       \u2212   n   y    \u2202  2 \u2202 x       \u2212   n   y    \u2202  2 \u2202 y        0      n   y         n   x         n   x    \u2202  2 \u2202 x         n   x    \u2202  2 \u2202 y        0   0   0      n   x         n   y        ]   [        \u03c3   x           \u03c3   y           \u03c4   s           m   x           m   y        ]  = R \u03c3   and  (26)  R = [   R   1      R   2   ]   where     R   1   =  [        n   x      0      n   y        0      n   y         n   x        0   0   0     ]  ,    R   2   =  [      \u2212   n   y    \u2202  2 \u2202 x       \u2212   n   y    \u2202  2 \u2202 y           n   x    \u2202  2 \u2202 x         n   x    \u2202  2 \u2202 y           n   x         n   y        ]        The stress\u2013strain relations  (27)  \u03c3 = D \u03b5   where D is defined in Eq. (7).  The prescribed displacements on the boundary  u \u00af  is given as  (28)   u \u00af  =   [  u \u02dc    v \u02dc    \u03c9 \u02dc  ]  T  = Lq   where  u \u02dc  ,  v \u02dc  are displacement interpolations,  \u03c9 \u02dc  is the rotation interpolation on the boundary and   q =    [    q   1   \u03a4       q   2   \u03a4       q   3   \u03a4  ]  T  ,  (   q   i   =   [       u   i         v   i         u   i , x         u   i , y         v   i , x         v   i , y       ]  T  ,  i = 1 , 2 , 3 ) .      In order to make the element with second-order accuracy in its domain and C0/C1 weak continuous on the interface between the adjacent elements, cubic interpolation for interface displacements (producing quadratic rotation) is introduced.

Using the parameters at nodes 1 and 2, which are   u   i   ,    v   i   and   u   i , x   ,   v   i , x   ,   u   i , y   ,   v   i , y     ( i = 1 , 2 ) , the interpolations of the displacements  u \u02dc  and  v \u02dc  on 1\u20132 boundary are given as beam functions  (29)   u \u02dc  =   N   1      u   1   +   N   s 1      u   1 ,  s   +   N   2      u   2   +   N   s 2      u   2 ,  s    v \u02dc  =   N   1      v   1   +   N   s 1      v   1 ,  s   +   N   2      v   2   +   N   s 2      v   2 ,  s     where shape functions   N   1   ,   N   s 1   ,   N   2   ,   N   s 2   are  (30)  {        N   1   =   L   1   +   L   1     L   2   (   L   1   \u2212   L   2   )         N   s 1   = (   L   1     L   2   +   L   1     L   2   (   L   1   \u2212   L   2   ) ) \u22c5 L / 2         N   2   =   L   2   +   L   1     L   2   (   L   2   \u2212   L   1   )         N   s 2   = ( \u2212   L   1     L   2   +   L   1     L   2   (   L   1   \u2212   L   2   ) ) \u22c5 L / 2        where L is the beam length, and   L   1   = 1 \u2212 s / L ,    L   2   = s / L , in which s is the coordinate along the 1\u20132 boundary.  In Eq. (29), at nodes 1 and 2 the relationship between parameters   u   i , s   ,    v   i , s    and    u   i , x   ,    u   i , y   ,    v   i , x   ,    v   i , y    ( i = 1 , 2 ) can be expressed as  (31)    u   i , s   = \u2212   n   y     u   i , x   +   n   x     u   i , y     v   i , s   = \u2212   n   y     v   i , x   +   n   x     v   i , y     where     n   x   =     y   2   \u2212   y   1         (   x   2   \u2212   x   1   )  2  +   (   y   2   \u2212   y   1   )  2      ,    n   y   =     x   1   \u2212   x   2         (   x   2   \u2212   x   1   )  2  +   (   y   2   \u2212   y   1   )  2        are the direction cosines of the element boundary as shown in Fig. 1.   Interpolations of rotation component   \u03c9 \u02dc   of boundary displacement vector   u \u00af  .  To derive the interpolation of rotation  \u03c9 \u02dc  in Eq.

A new method for the formulation of hybrid elements with 5 \u03b2 terms stresses was reported by Pian [21], which contains a minimum number of stress parameters. Orthogonal approach for hybrid element methods was developed by Chen and Sze et al. [25\u201328].  In this paper, after confirmation of proper matrix P , refined technology is introduced by improving the displacement interpolations  u \u00af  on the boundary. Refined method was proposed by Chen and Cheung [29,30] to improve nonconforming elements.  Using the parameters at nodes 1 and 2, which are   u   i   ,   v   i   and   u   i , y   ,    v   i , x    ( i = 1 , 2 ) an alternative expression of the rotation interpolations on the boundary can be given as  (38)     \u03c9 \u02dc   \u204e  =   L   1     \u03c9   1   +   L   2     \u03c9   2   =   1 2   (   L   1     u   1 , y   +   L   2     u   2 , y   \u2212   L   1     v   1 , x   \u2212   L   2     v   2 , x   )   where   \u03c9   1   ,    \u03c9   2   are the rotation at nodes 1 and 2.  Eq. (38) with linear accuracy and Eq. (36) with quadratic accuracy are two kinds of rotation interpolations on the boundary. Both of them can satisfy the requirement to pass the C0\u20131 patch test. In order to improve the element\u2019s accuracy, an alternative expression of the rotation for refined hybrid stress element can be written as  (39)   \u03c9 \u02dc  + \u03b1 (  \u03c9 \u02dc  \u2212    \u03c9 \u02dc   \u204e  )   where \u03b1 is a constant to be determined empirically later.  It should be stressed here that \u03b1 is not fundamental to the present formulation, since the results in  Table 4 show that the refined elements can all pass the patch test, irrespective of whether \u03b1 is equal or unequal to zero. Indeed \u03b1 is only used as a tool to improve the performance of the element.  Based on Eqs. (29) and (39), the matrix L on the 1\u20132 boundary for refined hybrid stress element can be expressed as follows:  (40)   u \u00af  =   [  u \u02dc      v \u02dc     \u03c9 \u02dc  + \u03b1 (  \u03c9 \u02dc  \u2212    \u03c9 \u02dc   \u204e  ) ]  T  =   L   1 \u2212 2      q   1 \u2212 2     where \u03b1 is determined by using comparison of accuracy of numerical examples (in Section 5.3, Stress concentration at the boundary of a hole). In this paper, the refined technique only uses the refined rotation part  \u03c9 \u02dc  as Eq. (39). From the calculation results it is found that the best results are achieved when \u03b1 = \u2212 1 . Then we suggest the value \u03b1 = \u2212 1 when using the 18-DOF refined hybrid stress element.  Then, along the boundary 1\u20132, G can be obtained  (41)    G   12   =  \u222b  \u2202 \u03a9 ( 1 \u2212 2 )      ( RP )  T  L       1 \u2212 2    d s       Similarly, along the other boundaries, G 23, G 31 can also be obtained by cyclic permutation.  Once solving the element nodal displacement vector q , the element stresses can be given by Eq. (21)   (42)  \u03c3 =  [       \u03c3   a         \u03c3   c       ]  =  [       P   1     \u03b2   a         P   2     \u03b2   c       ]  =  [       P   1      H   1    \u2212 1   Gq       P   2      H   2    \u2212 1   Gq     ]       The stress smooth techniques introduced by Zienkiewicz et al. [31,32] for displacement elements can be used to improve the accuracy of the hybrid stress element. In Eq. (40), the smooth stresses are chosen as   \u03c3   a   =   P   1     \u03b2   a   ,   \u03b2   a   = [   \u03b2   1   \u22ef   \u03b2   N    ] , and N =11 (the number of {    \u03b2   i    }   Table 2).  Based on the enhanced patch test proposed by Chen and Soh [18,33], the test function can be assumed as follows:  (43)  {      u =   a   1   +   a   2   x +   a   3   y +   a   4     x  2  + a  x    5   y +   a   6     y  2        v =   b   1   +   b   2   x +   b   3   y +   b   4     x  2  + b  x    5   y +   b   6     y  2         where   a   i   ,   b   i    ( i = 1 \u2026 6 ) are constants to be determined.  Substituting Eq. (43) into equilibrium Eq. (8), the test functions for couple stress element can be obtained as follows:  (44)  {      u =   a   1   +   a   2   x +   a   3   y +   a   4     x  2  \u2212 2 [ ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   b   4   + 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   b   6   ] x y +   a   6     y  2        v =   b   1   +   b   2   x +   b   3   y +   b   4     x  2  \u2212 2 [ 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   a   4   + ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   a   6   ] x y +   b   6     y  2            The rotation test functions   u   x   ,    u   y   ,    v   x   ,    v   y   are first derivatives of Eq. (44)   (45)  {        u   x   =   a   2   + 2   a   4   x \u2212 2 [ ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   b   4   + 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   b   6   ] y         u   y   =   a   3   \u2212 2 [ ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   b   4   + 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   b   6   ] x + 2   a   6   y         v   x   =   b   2   + 2   b   4   x \u2212 2 [ 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   a   4   + ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   a   6   ] y         v   y   =   b   3   \u2212 2 [ 2 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   a   4   + ( 1 \u2212 2 \u03bc )   a   6   ] x + 2   b   6   y        where   a   1   ,    a   2   ,    a   3   ,    a   4   ,    a   6   ,    b   1   ,    b   2   ,    b   3   ,    b   4   ,    b   6   are arbitrary constants.  This set of displacement components gives linear rotation and constant curvatures.  In this test, the coefficients   a   i   and   b   i   of the test functions in Eqs. (44) and (45) are listed in Table 3.  The size of the domain is 0.24 \u00d7 0.12 , the material parameters are l = 0.5 , E = 1000 and \u03bc = 0.25 . Fig. 2 shows the mesh used for the patch test. The displacements at the nodes on the boundaries are imposed according to Eq. (44) and Table 3.  The numerical results of the patch test at node 1 are listed in Table 4. The results of the patch test demonstrate that both the refined hybrid stress element and standard hybrid stress element can pass the enhanced patch test.  In this section, the beam model and meshes are shown in Fig. 3(1) and (2) which are same as those in Stolken\u2019s micro-bending test [34] and material constants of the beams: length of the beam L = 250  \u03bc m , depth of the beam h = 12.5  \u03bc m , the elastic modulus E = 220  GPa , Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bc = 0.31 , the bending moment M = 50  N  \u03bc m . The analytical solution [35] is given as  (46)  v = \u2212   6 M ( 1 \u2212   \u03bc  2  )   E h [   h  2  + 24 ( 1 \u2212 \u03bc )   l  2  ]    (    x  2  +  \u03bc  1 \u2212 \u03bc     y  2   )       Numerical analysis is done by triangular couple stress hybrid stress element. Keep the beam constant and change the material constant l to examine the scale effect.  Numerical results of the deflection of the beam are given in  Figs. 4 and 5, which show that the deflection of the beam in couple stress theory is smaller than that in the classical elasticity ( l = 0 ) as the material constant l increases. The numerical results show that the strong size effects appear in the beam also show that triangular hybrid stress element for couple stress theory applied here has high accuracy.  Stress concentration problems can be used to check the size effect and the accuracy of the element. An infinitely large elastic plate containing a circular hole of radius r shown in Fig. 6 is subjected to a uniformly distributed force p in the x direction. Different values of the Poisson ratio ( \u03bc = 0.0 and \u03bc = 0.5 ) and material characteristic length l are used in the analyses. To avoid denominator being zero in constitutive Eq. (7), \u03bc = 0.49999 is used to substitute \u03bc = 0.5 . Material constants are same as those in Ref. [36]: side length 2 L = 32.4  mm , the elastic modulus E = 200  GPa , tension application in two sides p = 1  Pa . Owing to symmetry in geometry and boundary conditions, only a quarter of plate is meshed for the analysis.  The analytical solution can be found in Ref. [37], in which the method of separation variables is applied to solve the stress concentration around the circular hole in a field of uniform tension with the couple stress theory.  The parameter \u03b1 in Eq. (39) for refined hybrid element is determined by comparison using numerical examples. Numerical examples show that the results of pure bending beam are less sensitive to \u03b1 but the results of stress concentration problem are sensitive to \u03b1 . After analysis of numerical examples shown in   Figs. 8 and 9, refined hybrid stress element has higher accuracy when \u03b1 = \u2212 1 . It should be noted that the functions of the parameters    u \u02dc    , y   ,    v \u02dc    , x   have linear accuracy on the boundary when \u03b1 = \u2212 1 , and the element is standard hybrid stress element when \u03b1 = 0 .     Tables 5 and 6 and  Figs. 10 and 11 show the convergence of the element performance with mesh refinement. As shown in Fig. 7, NC is the number of elements on the boundary of 1/4 hole( three meshes with NC=4, 6, 8). The performance of refined hybrid stress element is good enough as the mesh is refined to NC=8 with 256 elements and 153 nodes.  The performance of the hybrid stress element is also compared with the following elements formulated by Shu et al. [36]:  QU34L4, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 34-DOF and 4 Lagrange multipliers.  QU54L16, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 54-DOF and 16 Lagrange multipliers.  QU34L4+QU34L16, a 9-node quadrilateral element with 34-DOF and 16 Lagrange multipliers.  TU24L4, a 6-node triangular element with 24-DOF and 4 Lagrange multipliers.     Tables 7 and 8 show the stress concentration factors on the boundary of the circular hole obtained by various elements for \u03bc = 0.0 and \u03bc = 0.5 , respectively. The percentage errors in the numerical solutions are listed within parentheses. The stress concentration factor plots against l / r are shown in  Figs. 12 and 13 (in order to show the relationship more clearly, two typical elements QU34L4 and TU24L4 are selected and compared with refined hybrid stress element in the plots). In Ref. [36], all computations were carried out using a mesh of 720 quadrilaterals and 2983 nodes. Triangular elements were generated by sub-dividing a quadrilateral along a diagonal. However, the mesh employed in this study only consists of 256 elements and 153 nodes. A comparison of the results obtained by the refined hybrid stress element with those given in Ref. [36] reveals that the element proposed in this paper is more accurate than the element TU24L4. Indeed, the refined hybrid stress element attained a similar accuracy compared with elements QU34L4, QU54L16 and QU34L4 +QU34L16 with a mesh of less than one-tenth of nodes (256 elements and 153 nodes against 720 elements and 2983 nodes). The elements in Ref. [36] have 6 DOF for each corner node and 2 DOF for each mid-side node, and 2983 nodes were used in the numerical examples.  In this section, a simple shear problem is solved herein. Due to its simplicity, this problem (or its variants) has recently been studied analytically or computationally as a benchmark problem [38]. Consider a block of width w , length L , and height h undergoing a simple shear deformation, as shown in Fig. 13. Assume L and w that are much larger than h such that they both can be viewed as infinite. The prescribed displacement    u \u02dc    0   is induced by a shear force acting on the top boundary y = h .  Numerical results are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, where the classical elasticity solution [38] is also displayed for comparison. For illustration purpose, the material properties for the block are taken to be E = 1.44  GPa , \u03bc = 0.38 , l = 17.6  \u03bc m . To see the influence of material microstructure (as represented by l ), two other cases with different values of l (i.e., l = 8.8  \u03bc m and l = 1.76  \u03bc m ) are also included in this parametric study. The geometric parameters used here are h = 100  \u03bc m ,    u \u02dc    0   = 1  \u03bc m .  It is seen from  Figs. 15 and 16 that the boundary layer (or sticking) effect can be captured by the present solution. Also, it can be observed that the influence of the microstructure (through l ) can be significant: the larger the value of l , the larger the difference between the predictions by the present solution and by the classical elasticity solution. The numerical results quantitatively show that the influence of the length scale parameter can be significant.   CONCLUSIONS   This paper presents a hybrid stress element method, which is perfectly fit for establishing couple stress element. The method can satisfy the condition of enhanced patch test easily as long as the chosen functions can satisfy the equilibrium equations in the domain of the element, such as the 15 \u03b2 Airy stress functions and the boundary displacement interpolation functions using the node parameters in this paper. Other methods reach the condition after much difficulty and jolting or cannot reach the condition. The formulae of hybrid stress element method are simple and practical.  Refined method is used to improve the accuracy of the element just by changing the value of \u03b1 , and it really works. Moreover, stresses smooth technique is also a necessity and effective way to improve the stress accuracy.  A refined 18-DOF triangular hybrid stress element is given out in the paper, and is used for numerical analysis on pure bending problem, stress concentration problem and simple shear problem. Our examples show that the element, with simple form formulae, high precision and stability of convergence, can pass the patch test and be used for multi-scale analysis.
