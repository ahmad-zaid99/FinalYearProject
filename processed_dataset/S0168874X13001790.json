Flexural and stability behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates is investigated.      Influence of span to thickness ratio, boundary conditions etc. on the structural behavior is investigated.

KEYPHRASES   Finite element method  Composite plates  Sandwich plates  Static  Buckling  Shear deformation theory   The use of composite material for the structure/component design has grown significantly over the last few decades because their response characteristics can be tailored to meet specific design requirements. Furthermore, composite structures possess high specific stiffness and high specific strength which leads to overall reduction of weight, thereby increasing the efficiency of the structure.  The plates form an essential component for the structural design in aerospace, naval, civil and automobile industries. In many applications, laminated composite and sandwich plates are subjected to transverse and in-plane loads. The excessive stresses induced due to application of these loads may cause failure. In addition to excessive stresses, in-plane compressive loads may alter the equilibrium configuration of a flat plate and hence cause failure due to buckling. Therefore, a compendious and reliable treatment for the behavior of the composite plates becomes essential. Various mathematical techniques regarding the formulation of the plate problem, structural kinematics, and solution methodology have been developed in the past few decades. A plate problem can be formulated using the elasticity principles or energy methods. The formulation using the theory of elasticity becomes complicated for composite plates since the involvement of field variables is large as compared to monolithic plates. Structural kinematics comprises of displacement based, stress based or hybrid approaches. Exact and approximate solutions can be implemented to solve the coupled differential equations for the laminated composite plate. The significance of shear deformation [1\u20134] in composite plates necessitates the use of shear deformation theories instead of classical plates theories based upon Kirchoff's hypothesis. Reissner [5,6] studied the effects of transverse shear deformation on the elastic plates using the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The requirement of shear correction factor and its dependency on the boundary conditions, stacking sequence, and lamination sequence make FSDT less realistic [7]. Higher-order shear deformation theories (HSDTs) involving parabolic transverse shear distribution were proposed by Levinson [8], Lo et al. [9], and Reddy [10]. Over the last few decades, the rapid advancements in the use of composite structures have motivated researchers to develop rigorous plate theories accounting for accurate structural kinematics especially shear deformation. Notably among them are due to Kant and Pandya [11], Touratier [12], Soldatos [13], Karama et al. [14], Aydogdu [15], Meiche et al. [16], Grover et al. [17], and Mantari et al. [18,19]. In recent years, researchers have focused on inter-laminar continuity (IC) and Zig-Zag (ZZ) requirement [20] in addition to shear deformation. These classes of theories are called layerwise (LW) and zig-zag theories. The significant evolution towards this class of theories is due to Lee and Liu [21], Di Sciuva [22], Murakami [23], Cho and Parmerter [24], Carrera [25], Ferreira et al. [26], Roque et al. [27], and Pandit et al. [28,29]. These theories predict the inter-laminar behavior at the cost of high computational efforts since the involvement of field variables is large. Along with the development of plate theories, there has been significant development towards the solution methodologies. Analytical solutions are most accurate and different analytical techniques have been proposed for structural responses of laminated composite plates; however, they are applicable for a particular class of plate configuration and hence less appropriate for practical applications. The development of computational technologies in the present industry makes it quite possible to implement numerical/approximate methods for the practical applications. In the numerical investigations, Ritz methods [30], finite strip method [31,32], discrete singular convolution (DSC) method [33], finite element method (FEM) [34,35], and mesh-less methods [26] have been widely used for the structural responses. Among these, FEM is most popular and versatile method for investigating the structural behavior of arbitrary shaped components. The development of finite element methods and shear deformation theories has been well documented in the review articles by Noor and Burton [36], Reddy [37], Reddy and Robbins [38], Mallikarjuna and Kant [39], Liu and Li [40], Ghugal and Shimpi [41], Carrera [42,] and Zhang and Yang [43].  In the present work, a generalized finite element model for laminated composite and sandwich plates by implementing recently developed an inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory (IHSDT) by the authors [44] is formulated in view of assessing responses of general laminates subjected to various combination of boundary conditions. The present inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory requires the use of C1 continuous element; however, in the present work, additional degrees of freedom are imposed in order to reduce the continuity requirement to C0 thereby making it computationally more efficient. Moreover, the finite element modeling has been generalized for all existing shear deformation theories involving shear strain function. An eight noded serendipity element with 56 degrees of freedom is used to discretize the plate. Influences of lamination sequence (cross ply and angle ply), span to thickness ratio, and boundary conditions are investigated for the flexural behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Further, the stability behavior of plates subjected to in-plane loads (uni-axial and bi-axial) is investigated for a variety of examples. Effects of boundary conditions on the critical buckling loads and their mode shapes are also assessed for a class of laminates in order to show the efficacy of the present mathematical technique to predict the buckling mode shapes. The results are compared with exact solution and other mathematical treatments and validity and efficacy of the present formulation and methodology is made certain.  In order to consider the improved structural kinematics in terms of inverse hyperbolic shear strain function and propose the methodology for a general laminated plate, we consider a multilayered plate with dimensions (a\u00d7b\u00d7h) in the Cartesian co-ordinates x\u2013y\u2013z as shown in Fig. 1.  Recently developed inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory by the authors [44] is chosen as the displacement field for the structural kinematics of the laminated plate. The in-plane displacement components (u, v) possess the through-thickness variation while the transverse displacement (w) is assumed to be constant over the thickness (h) of the plate as follows:  (1)  u ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   +  (  sin    h   \u2212 1    (    r z  h   )  \u2212 z   2 r   h     r  2  + 4      )    \u03b8   x   ( x , y ) v ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) \u2212 z   \u2202   w   0     \u2202 y   +  (  sin    h   \u2212 1    (    r z  h   )  \u2212 z   2 r   h     r  2  + 4      )    \u03b8   y   ( x , y ) w ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y )   The above displacement field assumes the non-linear distribution of transverse shear stresses across the thickness and also satisfies the condition of zero transverse shear on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate. The mid plane (z=0) displacement components are expressed as u 0, v 0, and w 0 while \u03b8  x and \u03b8  y are the shear deformations. The parameter r is the shape parameter whose value is ascertained as 3.0 by the inverse method in the post processing step [44]. The essential continuity requirement of the finite element applicable to the above displacement field is C1 continuity; however difficulties associated with C1 continuous finite element make the computational process quite expensive. Therefore, in order to reduce the continuity requirement to C0, first order derivatives of the transverse displacement appearing in the in-plane displacement terms are considered as separate independent degrees of freedom. Thus, the displacement field is modified by introducing the additional degrees of freedom \u03c6  x =w, x and \u03c6  y =w, y , so as to ensure the C0 continuity requirement and given in Eq. (2).  (2)  u ( x , y , z ) =   u   0   ( x , y ) \u2212 z   \u03d5   x   ( x , y ) + [ g ( z ) + \u03a9 z ]   \u03b8   x   ( x , y ) v ( x , y , z ) =   v   0   ( x , y ) \u2212 z   \u03d5   y   ( x , y ) + [ g ( z ) + \u03a9 z ]   \u03b8   y   ( x , y ) w ( x , y , z ) =   w   0   ( x , y )   where g(z)=sin h \u22121(rz/h) and \u03a9=\u22122r/(h(r 2+4)1/2). The representation of inverse hyperbolic shear strain function in terms of g(z) and \u03a9 generalizes the present formulation and ensures the implementation of other shear strain functions developed in Refs. [14\u201319]. The artificial constraints arising due to introduction of the additional degrees of freedom are imposed variationally incorporating the following constraint equations in total potential energy of the system.  (2a)  \u2202   w   0   / \u2202 x \u2212   \u03d5   x   = 0 ;  \u2202   w   0   / \u2202 y \u2212   \u03d5   y   = 0      The strain displacement relations under the assumption of small displacements but moderate rotations are expressed as von-Karman non-linear relations.     { \u03b5 }   5 \u00d7 1   = {   \u03b5   L   } + {   \u03b5   N L   }      (3)    { \u03b5 }   5 \u00d7 1   =   [       \u03b5   x x         \u03b5   y y         \u03b3   x y         \u03b3   y z         \u03b3   z x       ]  T  {   \u03b5   L   } =   [     u   ,   x       v   ,   y       u   ,   y   v   ,   x       v   ,   z   + w   ,   y       u   ,   z   + w   ,   x       ]  T  {   \u03b5   N L   } =   [        1 2     ( w   ,   x   )  2        1 2     ( w   ,   y   )  2        1 2   ( w   ,   x   ) ( w   ,   y   )    0   0     ]  T    The linear part of strain\u2013displacement relations contribute towards the elastic stiffness while for formulating geometric stiffness, non-linear part is employed.  The stress\u2013strain relation of a kth orthotropic layer having fiber orientation, \u03b1 with respect to structural co-ordinate system (x\u2013y\u2013z) are expressed as  (4)    { \u03c3 }   5 \u00d7 1   =   [    Q  \u00af     i j   ]   ( k )     { \u03b5 }   5 \u00d7 1     where the transformed reduced stiffness matrix,   [    Q  \u00af     i j   ]   ( k )   is obtained in terms of material properties (E 1, E 2, G 12, G 23, G 13, and \u03bd 12) and fiber orientation (\u03b1) of kth layer.  An eight noded iso-parametric serendipity biquadratic quadrilateral element is used to discretize the plate geometry. An element with seven degrees of freedom per node is considered to ensure the continuity requirement. The shape functions at node i for an eight noded serendipity element are as follows:  (5)    N   i   =  {        1 4   ( 1 + \u03be   \u03be   i   ) ( 1 + \u03b7   \u03b7   i   ) ( \u03be   \u03be   i   + \u03b7   \u03b7   i   \u2212 1 )     for     i = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4         1 2   ( 1 \u2212   \u03be  2  ) ( 1 + \u03b7   \u03b7   i   )     for     i = 5 , 7         1 2   ( 1 \u2212   \u03b7  2  ) ( 1 + \u03be   \u03be   i   )     for     i = 6 , 8         Consequently, the element geometry and field variables can be expressed in terms of shape functions as follows:  (6)  \u03c2 =  \u2211  i = 1  8     N   i     \u03c2   i     and  q =  \u2211  i = 1  8     N   i     q   i      where \u03c2 is the generalized geometrical co-ordinate, \u03c2  i is the value of corresponding coordinate at node i and q is the generalized field variable with q  i as the value of field variable at node i.  The linear strains as expressed in Eq. (3) are implemented in order to formulate the element stiffness matrix and hence the strain energy due to linear strains. The components of linear strains are written in terms of generalized strains which are functions of generalized degrees of freedom.

Further the generalized strains {  \u03b5 \u00af  } can be expressed in terms of field variables, {q} as follows:  (8)    {    \u03b5 \u00af    l   }   13 \u00d7 1   =   [ L ]   13 \u00d7 7     {   q   i   }   7 \u00d7 1     where   {   q   i   }   7 \u00d7 1   =   [       u   0         v   0         w   0         \u03b8   x         \u03b8   y         \u03d5   x         \u03d5   y       ]  T     The elemental strain\u2013displacement relations for jth element can now be obtained by making use of Eq. (6) in Eq. (8) and are shown below  (9)    {    \u03b5 \u00af    l   }   j   =   [ B ]   j     {   q   i   }   j     The strain energy due to linear strain for the jth element is derived using Eqs. (7) and (4) and (9) in the following manner:  (10)    U   l   ( j )   =   1 2    \u222b v     {   \u03b5   l   }   j   T   { \u03c3 }   d v =   1 2    \u222b v     {   \u03b5   l   }   j   T   [    Q  \u00af     i j   ]   {   \u03b5   l   }   j     d v =   1 2    \u222b v     {    \u03b5  \u00af     l   }   j   T     [ H ]   j   T   [    Q  \u00af     i j   ]   [ H ]   j     {    \u03b5  \u00af     l   }   j     d v =   1 2    \u222b s     {  q  \u00af   }   j   T     [ B ]   j   T     [ D ]   j     [ B ]   j     {  q  \u00af   }   j     d x  d y =   1 2     {  q  \u00af   }   j   T   [   K   j   ]   {  q  \u00af   }   j        Total strain energy due to linear strains is obtained by performing assembly over all the elements and is expressed in terms of global displacement vector, {q} and global elastic stiffness matrix, [K] as follows:  (11)    U   l   =  \u2211  j = 1   n e l      U   l   ( j )    =   1 2     { q }  T  [ K ] { q }      Geometric stiffness matrix depends not only on geometry but also on the existing internal forces such as in-plane normal (S  xx , S  yy ) and in-plane shear (S  xy ). Non-linear strain\u2013displacement relations are employed to formulate elemental geometric stiffness matrix and hence strain energy due to nonlinear strains. The derivation procedure of strain energy due to nonlinear strains is similar to that of strain energy due to linear strains. The strain energy of j-th element due to nonlinear strains is as  (12)    U   n l   ( j )   =   1 2    \u222b v     {   \u03b5   n l   }   j   T     { \u03c3 }   j     d v =   1 2    \u222b v     {   \u03b5   n l   }   j   T   [ S ]   {   \u03b5   n l   }   j     d v =   1 2    \u222b v     {    \u03b5  \u00af     n l   }   j   T     [   H   g   ]   j   T   [ S ]   [   H   g   ]   j     {    \u03b5  \u00af     n l   }   j     d v =   1 2    \u222b s     {  q  \u00af   }   j   T     [   B   G   ]   j   T     [ G ]   j     [   B   G   ]   j     {  q  \u00af   }   j     d x  d y =   1 2     {  q  \u00af   }   j   T     [   K   G   ]   j     {  q  \u00af   }   j     where   [ G ] =  \u2211  k = 1   n l     \u222b    z   l       z   u        [   H   G   ]  T  [ S ] [   H   G   ] d z   ;  S =  [        S   x x         S   x y           S   x y         S   y y        ]       The in-plane stresses, S  xy and S  yy are expressed in terms of S  xx as S  yy =\u03bb 1 S  xx and S  xy =\u03bb 2 S  xx    Performing the assembly over all the elements in the domain gives the total strain energy due to nonlinear strains in terms of global geometric stiffness matrix, [K G] as follows:  (13)    U   n l   =  \u2211  j = 1   n e l      U   n l   ( j )    =  1 2    { q }  T  [   K   G   ] { q }      The strain energy, arising due to imposition of artificial constraints as indicated in Eq. (2a) in the process of reduction in continuity requirement, is expressed in terms of penalty parameter, \u03b3 (taken as 106 in the present work) and field variables associated with artificial constraints and given as follows:  (14)    U   c   ( j )   =  \u03b3 2   \u222b V   [    (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   \u2212   \u03d5   x    )   j   T     (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   \u2212   \u03d5   x    )   j   +   (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 y   \u2212   \u03d5   y    )   j   T     (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 y   \u2212   \u03d5   y    )   j    ]  d   V   ( j )     Following the finite element implementation, U  c is expressed as:  (15)    U   c   =  \u03b3 2    { q }  T  [   K   c   ] { q }   where K  c is the global stiffness matrix arising due to artificial constraints.  Work done due to external load is as follows:  (16)  W =  \u2211  j = 1   n e l      W   j   ( e )    =  \u2211  j = 1   n e l     \u222b    A   j   ( e )     p ( x , y ) w  d   A   j   ( e )    =  \u2211  j = 1   n e l      {   f   ( e )   }   j      { q }   j   = { F } { q }   where [ f ] = [    0   0      p   0      0   0   0   0    ] ; with p 0 as the transverse load on the plate. For uniformly distributed load (UDL), p 0=q 0 while   p   0   =   q   0    sin ( \u03c0 x / a ) sin ( \u03c0 y / b ) for sinusoidal load (SSL).  Lagrange equation for the conservative system incorporating the essential terms related to flexural and stability behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates is given in Eq. (17) and the same is implemented to obtain the governing equations for the analyses.  (17)    \u2202   U   l     \u2202 {   q   i   }   + \u03bb   \u2202   U   n l     \u2202 {   q   i   }   +  \u2202  \u2202 {   q   i   }    [   \u03b3 2   \u222b V   (    (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   \u2212   \u03d5   x    )  T   (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 x   \u2212   \u03d5   x    )  +   (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 y   \u2212   \u03d5   y    )  T   (    \u2202   w   0     \u2202 y   \u2212   \u03d5   y    )   )  d V  ]  +   \u2202 W   \u2202 {   q   i   }   = 0   Implementing Eqs. (11) and (13)\u2013(16) in Eq. (17), we obtain the following algebraic equation:  (18)  [ K + \u03b3   K   C   ] { q } + \u03bb [   K   G   ] { q } = { F }      The plate is assumed to be under the effect of transverse loads only. The governing equations for the flexural analysis under the condition of static equilibrium are as  (19)  [ K + \u03b3   K   c   ] { q } = { F }      The above system of equations is solved to get the nodal displacements after applying the necessary boundary conditions. Further, the corresponding stresses are evaluated implementing the linear strains of Eq. (3) in Eq. (4). Since the stresses are derived quantities in IHSDT (a displacement based approach), special attention is required to evaluate the accurate nodal stresses.  The laminated plate is subjected to in-plane loads only and the in-plane stresses may induce instability in the plate which is expressed mathematically as an eigenvalue problem given in Eq. (20).  (20)  [ K + \u03b3   K   C   ] { q } + \u03bb [   K   G   ] { q } = 0      The objective of the eigenvalue problem is to evaluate critical values of \u03bb which make the stiffness matrix singular thereby inducing instability in the plate. Critical buckling loads correspond to the eigenvalues of Eq. (20) while the eigenvectors, q are associated with the corresponding mode shapes.   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   The present finite element model for the inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory is assessed for flexural and stability responses of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Effects of boundary conditions, stacking sequence (cross-ply and angle-ply), loading conditions, and span-thickness ratio on the response parameters are investigated and the results are compared with the existing results in order to ascertain the efficiency and accuracy of the present mathematical treatment. A generalized program is coded in MATLAB using the present generalized finite element formulation. Elemental stiffness matrix, elemental geometric stiffness matrix and load vector are obtained and then assembled over the complete domain of the plate. Selective integration Gauss-Quadrature technique is implemented to evaluate the domain integral since the direct application of the present finite element may induce shear locking especially for thin plates. The appropriate boundary conditions are applied before solving the particular problem for flexural and stability responses. The following degrees of freedom are restrained for different types of boundary conditions:  \u2022 Clamped condition (C):   u   0   =   v   0   =   w   0   =   \u03b8   x   =   \u03b8   y   =   \u03d5   x   =   \u03d5   y   = 0    Simply supported condition (S):  o Edge parallel to x-axis:   u   0   =   w   0   =   \u03b8   x   =   \u03d5   x   = 0    Edge parallel to y-axis:   v   0   =   w   0   =   \u03b8   y   =   \u03d5   y   = 0    The material models used for the analyses are: Material Model 1 (MM1)\u2014E 1/E 2=25, G 12/E 2=0.5, G 13/E 2=0.5, G 23/E 2=0.2, and \u03bd12=0.25 and Material Model 2 (MM2)\u2014E 1/E 2=variable, G 12/E 2=0.6, G 13/E 2=0.6, G 23/E 2=0.5, and \u03bd12=0.25.  Flexural response is investigated for the laminated composite plates subjected to transverse sinusoidal load (SSL) and uniformly distributed load (UDL). The displacements are evaluated at the nodal points while the stresses are primarily obtained at the Gauss points since the Gauss point stresses are most accurate. Gauss point stresses are extrapolated to nodal points and then nodal averaging is performed in order to evaluate accurate nodal stresses [45]. The proposed methodology is assessed for a variety of combinations of laminated plates and boundary conditions. Non-dimensional forms given in Eq. (21) are implemented to obtain non-dimensional results to ensure the comparison with the existing results.  (21)   w  \u00af   =   w   0    (   a 2  ,   b 2   )   (    100   E   2     h  3      b  4    q   0      )  ; [        \u03c3  \u00af     x x          \u03c3  \u00af     y y          \u03c3  \u00af     x y       ] = [       \u03c3   x x         \u03c3   y y         \u03c3   x y       ]  (      h  2      b  2    q   0      )  ; [        \u03c3  \u00af     y z          \u03c3  \u00af     x z       ] = [       \u03c3   y z         \u03c3   x z       ]  (   h  b   q   0      )       Flexural behavior of two layered [0/90] cross-ply anti-symmetric square laminate subjected to transverse sinusoidal load and governed by different combination of boundary conditions (SSSS, SCSS, SCSC, and CCCC) is investigated. Both layers are of equal thickness and are made of orthotropic material, MM1. Non-dimensional central transverse deflections are obtained for different mesh sizes in order to ensure the convergence of the finite element implementation. The convergence behavior of transverse deflection for span-thickness ratio (a/h) equal to 10 is shown in Fig. 2 and it is clear that monotonic convergence is achieved for anti-symmetric plate subjected to different boundary conditions. It is also clear from the convergence study that a mesh size of eight is sufficient for the accurate prediction of transverse deflection. Mesh size of eight means that each edge of the plate is discretized into eight segments.  The validation of the obtained results for plate with a/h=5, 10 along with existing results of HSDT [46], Huang and Li [47], FSDT [48] and Mantari et al. [18] is shown in Table 1 and the applicability of the present theory for different combinations of boundary conditions is made certain.  Further, the flexural behavior of simply supported anti-symmetric laminate is investigated under the influence of transverse uniform load and the effect of span-thickness ratio on non-dimensional deflection is observed. Both layers of the laminate [0/90] are of equal thickness and are composed of orthotropic material, MM2. The non-dimensional deflection is obtained for a/h=5, 10, and 40 and the results obtained are shown in Fig. 3 along with the existing results of Pandya and Kant [34], Turvey [49], and Kant and Pandya [50].  A four layered simply supported symmetric cross-ply [0/90/90/0] plate subjected to transverse sinusoidal load is considered for the flexural analysis. Laminated plate is composed of orthotropic material, MM1. Non-dimensional deflection and stresses at critical point are obtained for span-thickness ratio as 4, 10 and 100. Mesh refinement is performed employing a wide range of mesh sizes and the corresponding results for mesh sizes 4, 6, 10, 14, and 16 are shown in Table 2. Convergence study indicates that excellent convergence is obtained for the transverse deflection for mesh size up to 10; however, the convergence of stresses is achieved at mesh size 14 and 16. The difference in convergence for deflection and stresses is justified since the displacements are primary variables in the present displacement based approach and the stresses are derived quantities.   Table 2 also shows the existing results presented by Grover et al. [44], Rodrigues et al. [51], Reddy [10] and the exact solutions of Pagano [52]. A comparison of the present finite element solution with the analytical solution for IHSDT [44] and other methodologies shows that the present finite element methodology is excellent for the prediction of flexural response. The percentage error between the finite element solution and analytical solution based upon IHSDT [44] is 0.85\u20131.45%. It is to be noted that this error is towards the calculation of stresses; however, the transverse deflections are obtained with excellent accuracy with a maximum error of 0.13% for a/h=4.  Variation of non-dimensional in-plane normal stress,    \u03c3  \u00af     x x   across thickness is obtained for the same plate with a/h=10 and the results are compared with Grover et al. [44] as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows the distribution of transverse shear stress,    \u03c4  \u00af     y z   across thickness for the same plate along with the existing results of IHSDT [44], FSDT [10] and HSDT [10] implementing constitutive as well as equilibrium equations.  Two layered and four layered anti-symmetric laminated plates with all their edges simply supported are subjected to transverse sinusoidal load and its flexural behavior is analyzed for span to thickness ratio as 4 and 10. The material properties are considered as those of MM2 with material anisotropy ratio (E 1/E 2) as 40. Non-dimensional deflections as indicated in Eq. (21) are obtained for square and rectangular plates (b=3a) and the results are compared with the existing results in Table 3. The comparison of results affirms the applicability and accuracy of IHSDT for the flexural response of angle-ply plates.  Further, the effect of boundary conditions and material anisotropy on the non-dimensional deflection is investigated for the four layered [45/\u221245/45/\u221245] plate composed of MM2 with a/h ratio as 10 and the behavior is characterized in Fig. 5. It is observed that the plate with all its edges simply supported (SSSS) acquires the largest deflection, while the plate with all its edges clamped (CCCC) possesses the smallest deflection for a particular material anisotropy ratio. Moreover, the deflection of the plate with its opposite edges clamped (SCSC) is less than that of the plate with a single edge clamped (SCSS). This behavior is accounted for towards the fact that the stiffness of the plate increases by restraining more degrees of freedom thereby decreasing the deflection.  A simply supported laminated square sandwich plate with equal thickness (t  f =0.1h) face sheets and an orthotropic core composed of material model given in Eq. (22) is analyzed under the effect of uniform pressure. The material properties of face sheets are obtained by multiplying core properties by a parameter R. Flexural response of a moderately thick plate (a/h=10) is investigated for R=5, 10, and 15. Transverse deflection and stresses are obtained at the critical points and the results are presented in the non-dimensional forms given in Eq. (23).

A comparison of analytical [44] and the present finite element solutions of IHSDT indicate that the present finite element technique is capable of predicting transverse deflection within an error range of 0.008\u20130.2%, however, the percentage difference for the evaluation of stresses of the sandwich plate is in the range of 1.05\u20131.49%.  The application of finite element solution is further justified by presenting the transverse deflection of five layered clamped sandwich plate with anti-symmetric lay-up of face sheets [0/90/C/0/90] and subjected to transverse sinusoidal load. The face sheets of the sandwich plate are composed of MM1 and core properties are E 1c=E 2c=0.04E 2, G 12c=0.016E 2, G 23c=G 13c=0.06E 2 and \u03bd 12c =0.25 with core thickness as 0.8h while each face ply is 0.05h thick. Effect of span-thickness ratio on non-dimensional deflection is obtained and the behavior is shown in Fig. 6 along with the results of Pandit et al. [28] obtained using zig-zag theory. It is observed that for thick plates (a/h<10), IHSDT under-predicts the deflection as compared to zig-zag theory while for a/h>10, the behavior is in excellent agreement with Pandit et al. [28].  The eigenvalue problem obtained for stability behavior is solved to get the buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes. The buckling loads are obtained for in-plane uni-axial and bi-axial loads for a variety of numerical examples; however eigen modes for few cases are shown particularly in order to show the influence of boundary conditions on the mode shapes. The obtained results are presented in the form of non-dimensional buckling load parameter,    \u03bb  \u00af     c r   = \u03bb   a  2  / (   E   2     h  3  ) for the sake of comparison.  Simply supported symmetric laminated cross-ply plates composed of orthotropic material, MM2 are subjected to uni-axial compression (\u03bb 1=\u03bb 2=0) and their buckling behavior is investigated in terms of critical buckling load parameter. Effect of material anisotropy and number of layers is examined for the plate (a/h=10) and the results are listed in Table 5 along with the well established results. The accuracy of the present finite element solutions is ascertained by comparing with Navier solutions on IHSDT presented by Grover et al. [44]. The percentage difference of present solution with the analytical solution is ranging from 0.07% to 1.2% with an average difference of about 0.5%. The results are also found to be in excellent agreement with Putcha and Reddy [58], Liu et al. [59] and Ferreira et al. [60].  Also, the stability behavior of four layered symmetrically laminated plate is investigated in terms of mode shapes subjected to different boundary conditions and different values of load parameters (\u03bb 1, \u03bb 2).    Figs. 7\u201310 show the buckling mode shapes of SSSS and SCSC subjected to biaxial load (\u03bb 1=1, \u03bb 2=0) and biaxial with in-plane shear (\u03bb 1=1, \u03bb 2=1) load. The influence of boundary conditions and load parameters has been demonstrated on the buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes.  Further, a three layered symmetric cross ply laminate [0/90/0] with a/h=10 (MM2, E 1/E 2=40) is considered under biaxial compression (\u03bb 1=1, \u03bb 2=0). The buckling behavior is investigated for the plate subjected to different combination of boundary conditions and first four modes are evaluated. The results are compared with the existing results of Rodrigues et al. [62], Liew et al. [63], and Khdeir and Librescu [64] in Table 6 and it is concluded that the present finite element methodology in conjunction with IHSDT is excellent for the prediction of buckling load as well as higher modes for a variety of boundary conditions. The application of clamped boundary condition increases the stiffness and hence internal resistance of the structure to tolerate the in-plane loads.  A two layered anti-symmetric angle ply [45/\u221245] square laminated plate is considered for the stability behavior. The influence of bi-axial load increment (\u03bb 1=0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, and 1) on the non-dimensional buckling load is investigated for the considered laminated plate with different combination of boundary conditions and is shown in Fig. 11. It is observed that buckling load decreases with increase in bi-axial load parameter for particular boundary conditions. Also, the increment in buckling load with the application of clamped boundary conditions (SSSS to SCSC via SCSS) for a particular value of biaxial load parameter is accounted towards the fact that the stiffness of the structure increases due to more restrained degrees of freedom along the edges.  Further, the influence of fiber orientation, \u03b1 on the uni-axial buckling load parameter is investigated for two layered simply supported anti-symmetric laminate [45/\u221245] for a variety of span-thickness ratio (a/h=10, 20, and 100) and is illustrated in Fig. 12.   CONCLUSIONS   The applicability of inverse hyperbolic shear deformation theory for the analysis of general laminates is ascertained by presenting a generalized finite element formulation and methodology. The introduction of C0 finite element by considering additional degrees of freedom in the displacement field reduces the requirement of implementing C1 continuous element which is comparatively more computationally expensive and hence making the solution methodology efficient and applicable to more complicated/practical problems. The present methodology is assessed for numerous examples on flexural and stability behavior of laminated composite and sandwich plates and its validity is made certain. Influences of various parameters such as span-thickness ratio, boundary conditions, loading conditions are investigated for the analysis of laminated composite and sandwich plates. Higher buckling modes are obtained and effects of boundary conditions, biaxial load and in-plane shear load on the mode shapes are observed. The inverse hyperbolic function is represented in such a way that it generalizes the finite element formulation and hence ensures its implementation to all existing shear deformation theories involving shear strain function, which is a remarkable advantage providing the facility to use various theories for the analysis of laminated composite and sandwich plates.
