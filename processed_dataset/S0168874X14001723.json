Conserving time stepping algorithms have been used within the framework of the new contact formulation.      A selected number of quasi-static and dynamic numerical examples has been chosen to show the performance of the new contact formulation.      The performance of the conserving time stepping algorithm has been shown for a frictionless case.          KEYPHRASES   Contact mechanics  Full stick friction  Frictionless  Finite elements  Dynamics  Conserving algorithms   In this paper a new formulation for quasi-static and dynamic contact problems, under full stick friction and frictionless contact conditions, has been developed and implemented. The constraints arising in full stick and frictionless contact problems are imposed in a strong fashion by a direct elimination of the involved degrees of freedom of the resulting system of equations. Drawbacks inherent to the penalty method, such as the selection of suitable penalty parameters or the ill-conditioning of the system, are fully avoided. Furthermore, drawbacks linked to the Lagrange multipliers method, such as the need to dynamically expand the system of equations, adding new equations for the Lagrange multipliers, are also bypassed. Remarkably, the contact constraints are easily imposed by a number of transformations applied to the tangent stiffness matrix and residual vector of the problem without contact constraints. For frictionless contact dynamic problems, a conserving implicit time stepping algorithm has been presented and it has been shown that it preserves the conservation of the same properties (linear momentum, angular momentum and energy) exhibited by the continuum.  The performance of the contact formulation has been shown in a number of representative examples. It is well known that node-to-segment (NTS) based contact formulations, as the one shown here, do not pass the contact patch test. Nevertheless, the results obtained in the contact patch test show a convergence to the exact solution as the mesh is refined and the ratio between the master size elements and slave size elements increases. An assessment of the formulation has been performed in the analysis of two quasi-static benchmark tests. A very good correlation between numerical results obtained in this work and analytical (Hertz contact test) or numerical results, obtained with Abaqus and Marc FE codes, using the penalty method (3D punch indentation benchmark test), has been obtained. Finally, an assessment of the conserving implicit time-stepping algorithm is shown in the numerical simulation of a dynamic contact problem. The impact of two rigid bodies is considered and it is shown that discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and total energy are conserved.  As a final concluding remark, we would like to point out that despite the fact that over the last decade an important effort has been done looking for contact formulations which had as a design target the requirement to pass the patch test, those formulations usually imply an important additional computational cost, while node-to-segment (NTS) contact formulations can still provide very good results, being competitive for many engineering applications.

the computational modeling and numerical simulation of contact problems at finite deformations using the finite element method. Quasi-static and dynamic problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full stick friction and frictionless cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the contact problem, such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new direct elimination method is proposed. Conserving algorithms are also introduced for the proposed formulation for dynamic contact problems. An assessment of the performance of the resulting formulation is shown in a number of selected benchmark tests and numerical examples, including both quasi-static and dynamic contact problems under full stick friction and frictionless contact conditions. Conservation of key discrete properties exhibited by the time stepping algorithm used for dynamic contact problems is also shown in an example.   Numerical analysis of contact problems has been one of the hot research topics of interest over the last decades. Contact problems arise in many applications, such as in crashworthiness, projectile impact, and material forming processes, i.e. sheet metal forming, bulk forming, casting, friction stir welding, cutting, and powder compaction. Despite the important progresses achieved in computational contact mechanics, the numerical simulation of contact problems is still nowadays a complex task, mainly due to the highly nonlinear nature of the problem, potentially involving fully nonlinear kinematics, finite strains, large slips, nonlinear boundary conditions, complex frictional behavior phenomena, thermomechanical contact, etc.  Mathematically, the numerical analysis of a frictional contact problem amounts to finding the solution of an Initial Boundary Value Problem (IBVP) within a constrained solution space. The variational formulation of a frictional contact problem includes restrictions on the admissible variations in the tangent solution space induced by the contact constraints, yielding to Variational Inequalities (VI). See, for instance, Kikuchi and Oden [27] and Duvaut and Lions [19].  A regularization of the frictional contact constraints, using penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, allows us to bypass the need to find a solution within a constrained solution space and provides a very convenient displacement driven frictional contact formulation.  The penalty method can be considered as the standard regularization procedure for computational modeling of frictional contact problems and it has been widely used, for instance, by Oden and Pires [41], Oden and Martins [42], Hallquist et al. [22], Curnier and Alart [18], Benson and Hallquist [11], Wriggers et al. [62], Belytschko and Neal [10], Laursen [30,35,37], Laursen and Simo [29,31,32], Agelet de Saracibar [1,2], Petocz [44], Armero and Petocz [6,7], Agelet de Saracibar and Chiumenti [4], Agelet de Saracibar et al. [3,5], and Chiumenti et al. [17].  To avoid some well known drawbacks exhibited by the penalty method, such as the penalty sensitivity and possible ill-conditioning of the system of equations, while retaining his advantages, the augmented Lagrangian method has been used as an alternative regularization procedure. Within the frictional contact problems context, the augmented Lagrangian method has been used by Laursen (1992, 2002) [30,37], Simo and Laursen [50], Laursen and Simo [31,32], Wriggers and Zavarise [63], Laursen and Govindjee [33], Wriggers [64], Zavarise, Wriggers and Schrefler [66], and Chiumenti et al. [17], among others.  A perturbed Lagrangian method has been used, for instance, by Simo et al. [56] and Ju and Taylor [26].  A displacement driven formulation of the frictional contact problem allows to widely exploit the features of the framework developed for computational plasticity. See, for instance, Simo and Hughes [57] and Simo [53] for an excellent account of computational plasticity. In particular, return mapping algorithms developed for plasticity can be applied to integrate the frictional contact traction. The lowest order member of the family of backward-difference (BD) methods, the backward-Euler (BE) time integration algorithm, has become the standard frictional return mapping algorithm for the regularized frictional contact constrained evolution problem. Frictional return mapping algorithms using the BE method have been used by Giannakopoulos [20], Wriggers et al. [62], Laursen and Simo [31,32], Agelet de Saracibar [1,2], Agelet de Saracibar and Chiumenti [4], and Agelet de Saracibar et al. [3,5], among others. Within the family of Implicit Runge\u2013Kutta (IRK) methods, a generalized Projected Mid-Point (PMP) algorithm, initially proposed by Simo [53] for computational plasticity, has been proposed by Agelet de Saracibar [2] as frictional return mapping algorithm for the time integration of the frictional traction problem.  Typically, within the framework of the Finite Element (FE) method, most of the discrete frictional contact problems are formulated using the local parametrization induced by the FE triangularization of the contact surfaces. Due to the local character of the parametrization, the frictional time integration algorithm may turn out to be useless if large slips are involved. A new frictional time integration algorithm, designed to avoid the drawbacks arising from a local parametrization, being suitable for large slip multi-body frictional contact problems in 2D and 3D, has been developed by Agelet de Saracibar [1]. Time integration of the frictional traction is performed using Hermite interpolation functions and introducing a new slip path parametrization, which, remarkably, is defined on the sole basis of the outward unit normal to the master surface, being independently of the local surface finite element parametrization used in the spatial triangularization.  A pinball algorithm for contact-impact problems, using penalty and Lagrangian methods, has been presented by Belytschko and Neal [10].  It is well known that node-to-segment (NTS) contact formulations do not pass the contact patch test [47]. An alternative to the node-segment contact formulation is the mortar segment-to-segment contact formulation. A mortar segment-to segment contact formulation for large deformation solid mechanics has been presented by Puso and Laursen [45,46] and Yang [65]. Dual active set strategies based on the mortar method have been presented by Wohlmuth [59], H\u00fceber and Wohlmuth [24], and Brunssen et al. [14].  Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) was recently introduced by Hughes, Cottrell and Bazilevs [25]. Within the IGA framework, the same smooth and higher order basis functions, e.g. NURBS, are used for both the CAD geometry and the approximation of the FEA solution fields, leading to evident potential advantages in the description of interacting surfaces undergoing large displacements and large sliding, as recognized already in the first IGA paper [25]. A detailed and up-to-date review of isogeometric contact formulations can be found in Lorenzis, Wriggers and Hughes [38].  A computational model for frictionless contact problems using the null-space method and introducing a smoothing technique of the master surface using cubic B-spline interpolation has been presented by Mu\u00f1oz [40].  Time discrete conserving algorithms for nonlinear dynamics have been proposed by Simo and Wong [49], Simo and Tarnow [51], Simo et al. [52], Simo and Tarnow [54], Simo et al. [55], Gonzalez [21], Laursen and Meng [36], Armero and Romero [8], Meng and Laursen [39], and Armero [9]. The extension of time discrete conserving algorithms for frictionless and frictional contact problems has been done by Chawla [15], Laursen and Chawla [34], Chawla and Laursen [16], Petocz [44], and Armero and Petocz [6,7], among others. Bravo et al. [13] have proposed an Enhanced Energy Conserving Algorithm (EECA) formulation for time integration of frictionless contact\u2013impact problems using an enhanced penalty method, featuring energy, linear and angular momentum conservation. Energy consistent time stepping schemes for finite-dimensional mechanical systems with holonomic constraints have been presented by Betsch [12].  A fully nonlinear kinematics formulation of frictionless contact problems, including the derivation of the algorithmic contact operators, was presented by Wriggers and Simo [60] for 2D problems using linear surface elements, and by Parisch [43] for 3D problems using linear surface elements. An extension of the formulation to frictional contact problems was provided by Wriggers [61]. A general fully nonlinear kinematics formulation for multi-body frictional contact problems at finite strains in 2D and 3D, was first developed on a continuum setting by Laursen and Simo [31]. The fully nonlinear kinematics formulation of frictional contact problems developed by Laursen and Simo [31] was extended later on by Agelet de Saracibar [2] for coupled thermomechanical problems, Agelet de Saracibar and Chiumenti [4] to account for wear phenomena, and Agelet de Saracibar, Cervera and Chiumenti [3,5] to account for coupled thermoplastic problems including phase-change.  This paper deals with the computational modeling and numerical simulation of contact problems at finite deformations using the finite element method. Quasi-static and dynamic problems are considered and two particular frictional conditions, full stick and frictionless cases, are addressed. Lagrange multipliers and regularized formulations of the contact problem, such as penalty or augmented Lagrangian methods, are avoided and a new direct elimination method is proposed. A conserving algorithm is used for dynamic contact problems.  The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present the continuum formulation of the contact problem. Section 3 deals with the finite element formulation of the contactless problem. Section 4 deals with the finite element formulation and numerical solution of the full stick and frictionless contact cases, using the proposed direct elimination method. Finally, Section 5 deals with an assessment of the contact formulation proposed through a number of representative quasi-static and dynamic numerical examples, under full stick and frictionless contact conditions. The paper concludes with some final remarks. Appendix A, including details of the linearization of the tangent orthonormal basis defined at the closest-point-projection on the master surface, has been also included.

The superimposed dot refers to the material time derivative.  Assuming a linear Saint-Venant Kirchhoff elastic constitutive model for the body   \u212c   ( i )   , the free energy per unit of mass can be expressed as,  (2)    \u03a8   ( i )   (   E   ( i )   ) =  1  2   \u03c1   0       E   ( i )   :   \u2102   ( i )   :   E   ( i )     where   \u2102   ( i )   is the constant fourth order elastic constitutive tensor and   E   ( i )   is the Green\u2013Lagrange strain tensor [58].  Using the classical slave-master formulation of contact mechanics [1,2,29\u201333,37], let us denote the contact surfaces   \u0393   c   ( 1 )   and   \u0393   c   ( 2 )   as slave and master contact surfaces, respectively. Particles of the slave and master contact surfaces will be denoted as slave particles and master particles, respectively.

The material form of the linear momentum L and angular momentum J of the system are given by  (11)  L : =  \u2211  i = 1  2    \u222b    \u03a9   ( i )        \u03c1   0   ( i )     V   ( i )    d V   J : =  \u2211  i = 1  2    \u222b    \u03a9   ( i )        x   ( i )   \u00d7   \u03c1   0   ( i )     V   ( i )    d V        The total energy of a system E can be additively split as  (12)  E : = K + W +   \u03a0   e x t     where K, W and   \u03a0   e x t   are the kinetic energy, elastic strain energy and potential energy for the external loads, respectively, given by  (13)  K : =  \u2211  i = 1  2    \u222b    \u03a9   ( i )       1 2    \u03c1   0   ( i )     V   ( i )   \u22c5   V   ( i )    d V   W : =  \u2211  i = 1  2    \u222b    \u03a9   ( i )        \u03c1   0   ( i )     \u03a8   ( i )    d V     \u03a0   e x t   : =  \u2211  i = 1  2     \u03a0   e x t  ( i )      where   \u03a0   e x t  ( i )   is the potential energy for the external forces of body   \u212c   ( i )   .  It can be shown [8,9,21,34,49,51,52,54,55] that the linear momentum L, angular momentum J, and total energy E are conserved for a homogeneous Neumann boundary problem, characterized by zero body forces and zero natural boundary conditions, yielding zero potential energy for the external loads, i.e.   \u03a0   e x t   = 0 . The total energy E is also conserved if the external loading is conservative. A typical case of conservative external loading is the case of gravitational body forces and constant prescribed nominal tractions.  Let us consider first the finite element discretization of quasi-static and dynamic continuum problem without frictional contact constraints. Using a standard finite element discretization, the material coordinates   X   ( i )   \u2208    \u03a9 \u00af    h   ( i )   , displacements   u   ( i )   and material velocities   V   ( i )   of body   \u212c   ( i )   , take the form  (14)    X   ( i )   : =  \u2211  A = 1     n   n o d e   ( i )        N   A   ( \u03be )   X   A   ( i )    ,    u   ( i )   : =  \u2211  A = 1     n   n o d e   ( i )        N   A   ( \u03be )   u   A   ( i )    ,    V   ( i )   : =  \u2211  A = 1     n   n o d e   ( i )        N   A   ( \u03be )   V   A   ( i )      where   x   ( i )   : =   X   ( i )   +   u   ( i )   gives the current placement of the particle   X   ( i )   \u2208    \u03a9 \u00af    h   ( i )   of body   \u212c   ( i )   ,   X   A   ( i )   \u2208    \u03a9 \u00af    h   ( i )   ,   u   A   ( i )   and   V   A   ( i )   are the vectors of material coordinates, displacements and material velocities, respectively, of a node A of the triangulation of body   \u212c   ( i )   ,   N   A    ( \u03be )  :  \u25a1  \u21a6 \u211d is the interpolation shape function for node A, \u03be \u2208  \u25a1 are the isoparametric coordinates defined in the unit domain \u25a1 , and   n   n o d e   ( i )   is the number of nodes used in the triangulation of body   \u212c   ( i )   .  Consider the time interval of interest I = [ 0 , T ] discretized into a series of non-overlapping sub-intervals I = \u222a [   t   n   ,   t   n + 1   ] . Using the standard convention, we denote by either   ( \u22c5 )   n + \u03b1   the discrete approximations at time   t   n + \u03b1   of the continuum variable at time t.  The time discretization and finite element discretization of the variational form of the momentum balance equation for the quasi-static case yields the following expression for the residual force vector of a node A of body   \u212c   ( i )   at time n + 1    (15)    g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  : =   f   A , n + 1   int ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  \u2212   f   A , n + 1   e x t ( i )   = 0   where   g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  ,   f   A , n + 1   int  ( i )   : =   f   A , n + 1   int  ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  and   f   A , n + 1   e x t  ( i )   are the nodal vectors of residual forces, internal forces and external forces of node A of body   \u212c   ( i )   at the time n + 1 , respectively.  Using an incremental iterative Newton\u2013Raphson solution scheme, the linearization of the residual force vector given by (15) yields  (16)    g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k + 1    )  : =   g   A    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  + D   g   A    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i ) k   = 0   where  (17)  D   g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i )  k   = D   f   A , n + 1   int ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )  k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i ) k   =   K   A B , n + 1   ( i ) k   \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k     where   K   A B , n + 1   ( i )  k   is the AB matrix component of the tangent stiffness matrix evaluated at the iteration k of the time step n + 1 , and \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   =   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k + 1   \u2212   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   .  Using a mid-point time integration algorithm, the time discretization and finite element discretization of the variational form of the momentum balance equation for the dynamic case yields a discrete energy and momentum conserving time stepping algorithm, where the residual force vector of a node A of body   \u212c   ( i )   at time n + 1 , takes the form [8,9,21,34,49,51,52,54,55]   (18)    g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  : =  1  \u0394 t     M   A B   ( i )    (    V   B , n + 1   ( i )   \u2212   V   B , n   ( i )    )  +   f   A , n + 1 / 2   int  ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  \u2212   f   A , n + 1 / 2   e x t  ( i )   = 0   where   M   A B   ( i )   is the mass matrix of nodes A and B of body   \u212c   ( i )   ,   V   B , n + 1   ( i )   is the vector of velocities of node B of body   \u212c   ( i )   at the time n + 1 , given by  (19)    V   B , n + 1   ( i )   = 2   V   B , n + 1 / 2   ( i )   \u2212   V   B , n   ( i )   =  2  \u0394 t    (    u   B , n + 1   ( i )   \u2212   u   B , n   ( i )    )  \u2212   V   B , n   ( i )     and   f   A , n + 1 / 2   int  ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i )    )  and   f   A , n + 1 / 2   e x t  ( i )   are the nodal vectors of internal forces and external forces of node A of body   \u212c   ( i )   at the time n + 1 / 2 , respectively.  Using an incremental iterative Newton-Raphson solution scheme, the linearization of the discrete residual force vector given by (18) yields  (20)    g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k + 1    )  : =   g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  + D   g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i )  k   = 0   where  (21)  D   g   A   ( i )    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i ) k   =  2  \u0394   t  2      M   A B   ( i )   \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   + D   f   A , n + 1 / 2   int ( i ) k    (    u   n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   n + 1   ( i ) k   =  (   2  \u0394   t  2      M   A B   ( i )   +    K ^    A B , n + 1   ( i ) k    )  \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   : =   K   A B , n + 1   ( i ) k   \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k     where k denotes the iteration number,   K   A B , n + 1   ( i )  k   is the AB component of the tangent stiffness matrix evaluated at the iteration k of the time step n + 1 , and \u0394   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   =   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k + 1   \u2212   u   B , n + 1   ( i ) k   .  The space semi-discrete versions L  h , J  h and E  h of the linear momentum, angular momentum and total energy, respectively, take the form [6\u20139,51]:  (22)    L   h   : =  \u2211  i = 1  2    \u2211  A = 1     n   n o d e   ( i )        M   A B   ( i )     V   B   ( i )       J   h   : =  \u2211  i = 1  2     x   A   ( i )   \u00d7   M   A B   ( i )     V   B   ( i )      E   h   : =   K   h   +   W   h   +   \u03a0   h   e x t   =  \u2211  i = 1  2    1 2    V   A   ( i )   \u22c5   M   A B   ( i )     V   B   ( i )    +   W   h   +   \u03a0   h   e x t     where Einstein\u05f3s notation has been assumed for repeated indices A and B.  It can be shown [6\u20139] that using this conserving time integration scheme, the full discrete version of the linear momentum L  h , angular momentum J  h , and total energy E  h are conserved for a homogeneous Neumann boundary problem, characterized by no imposed boundary displacements and zero external loading, zero body forces and zero natural boundary conditions, yielding zero semi-discrete external force vector,   f   A   e x t  ( i )   = 0 , and zero semi discrete potential energy for the external loads,   \u03a0   h   e x t   = 0 . The discrete version of the total energy E  h is also conserved if the external loading is conservative.  Within the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems proposed in this work, the restrictions arising by the contact between the bodies are introduced through the direct elimination of the displacements of the slave nodes. From a computational implementation point of view, this direct elimination method is carried out through a number of transformations made on the global tangent operator. In order to conveniently visualize those transformations, let us introduce the following notation.  Let us consider a generic slave node s which is in contact with a given master element. Let us denote by {    m   1   , \u2026 ,   m   m n o d    } the set of master nodes of the master element which is in contact with the slave node s, where m n o d is the number of nodes of the master element.  Furthermore, let us introduce the following notation for the set of nodes of the slave body which are connected to the slave node s, including both the nodes on the slave surface and the nodes in the interior domain of the slave body, and to the set of nodes of the master surface which are connected to the master nodes {    m   1   , \u2026 ,   m   m n o d    } , including both the nodes of the master surface and the nodes in the interior domain of the master body.  Let us denote by {  g   s   1   , \u2026 , g   s   g s n o d    } the set of nodes of the slave body connected to the given slave node s, where g s n o d is the number of nodes of this set, and let us denote by {  g   m   1   , \u2026 , g   m   g m n o d    } the set of nodes of the master body connected to the set of nodes {    m   1   , \u2026 ,   m   m n o d    } , where g m n o d is the number of nodes of this set.    Fig. 1 shows the notation introduced for a typical slave node-master segment 2D contact problem using linear elements.  Linked to the notation introduced above for the slave and master nodes, let us introduce the following notation for the vector of displacements. Let us denote as u  s the vector of displacements of the slave node s, u  m the vector collecting the displacements of the set of nodes {    m   1   , \u2026 ,   m   m n o d    } ,   u   g s   the vector collecting the displacements of the set of nodes {  g   s   1   , \u2026 , g   s   g s n o d    } , and   u   g m   the vector collecting the displacements of the set of nodes {  g   m   1   , \u2026 , g   m   g m n o d    } ,   u   g 1   the vector collecting the vector of displacements of the remaining set of nodes of body   \u212c   ( 1 )   and   u   g 2   the vector collecting the vector of displacements of the remaining nodes of body   \u212c   ( 2 )   .  The vector position of an arbitrary point of a master surface element can be defined as  (23)  x =  \u2211  i = 1     n   m n o d        N   i   ( \u03be )   x   m i    =  \u2211  i = 1     n   m n o d        N   i   ( \u03be )   x   m i      where \u03be \u2208  \u25a1 are the isoparametric coordinates defined in the isoparametric unit domain \u25a1 ,   N   i    ( \u03be )  are the interpolation shape functions of the nodes of the master element,   N   i    ( \u03be )  =   N   i    ( \u03be )  1 is a diagonal matrix of shape functions.  The vector position of the closest-point-projection (CPP) of the slave node s on the master element can be defined as  (24)    x   C P P   =  \u2211  i = 1     n   m n o d        N   i    (  \u03be \u00af  )    x   m i    =  \u2211  i = 1     n   m n o d        N   i    (  \u03be \u00af  )    x   m i    = N   x   m     where  \u03be \u00af  \u2208  \u25a1 are the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection defined in the isoparametric unit domain \u25a1 , and N = [   N   1   (  \u03be \u00af  ) , \u2026 ,   N   m n o d   (  \u03be \u00af  ) ] is the matrix of nodal shape functions of the master nodes evaluated at  \u03be \u00af  \u2208  \u25a1 .  Using the notation introduced above, the semi-discrete contact normal gap   g   N   can be defined as  (25)    g   N   : =  (    x   s   \u2212   x   C P P    )  \u22c5 n =  (    x   s   \u2212  \u2211  i = 1     n   m n o d        N   i    (  \u03be \u00af  )    x   m i     )  \u22c5 n =  (    x   s   \u2212 N   x   m    )  \u22c5 n   where x  s is the current vector position of the slave node s and n is the outward unit normal to the master element at the closest-point-projection of the slave node s.  Let us consider first a slave node s which is not yet in contact with a master surface at time n + 1 . The residual force vectors can be written as  (26)    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  = 0   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1    )  = 0   g   g s    (    u   s

Newton\u2013Raphson solution scheme, the linearization of the residuals (26) takes the form:  (27)       g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  + D   g   s    (    u   s , n +

n + 1   k   and   K   s , g s , n + 1   k   are the tangent stiffness blocks corresponding to row s and columns s and g s , respectively,   K   m , m , n + 1   k   and   K   m , g m , n + 1   k   are the tangent stiffness blocks corresponding to row m and columns m and g m , respectively,   K   g s , s , n + 1   k   ,   K   g s , g s , n + 1   k   and   K   g s , g 1 , n + 1   k   are the tangent

The resulting global linearized system of equations for the contactless case can be written in matrix form as  (30)    [        K   s , s         K   s , g s      0   0   0   0        K   g s , s         K   g s , g s         K   g s , g 1      0   0   0     0      K   g 1 , g s         K   g 1 , g 1      0   0   0     0   0   0      K   m , m         K   m , g m      0     0   0   0      K   g m , m         K   g m , g m         K   g m , g 2        0   0   0   0      K   g 2 , g m         K   g 2 , g 2        ]   n + 1   k     [      \u0394   u   s         \u0394   u   g s         \u0394   u   g 1         \u0394   u   m         \u0394   u   g m         \u0394   u   g 2        ]   n + 1   k   = \u2212   [        g   s           g   g s           g   g 1           g   m           g   g m           g   g 2        ]   n + 1   k        Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s is subjected to the constraints arising from the full stick frictional contact condition. Note that for the full stick frictional case, once the slave node comes into contact with a master surface, the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection are time-independent, remaining constant in time while contact is active.  For a quasi-static case, the current position of the slave node s is attached to the current position of the closest-point-projection on the master surface, which is constant in time, yielding the following expression:  (31)         where  \u03be \u00af  \u2208  \u25a1 are the time-independent isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection.  For the dynamic case, using a discrete linear momentum and energy conserving time integration scheme, the mid-point velocity of the slave node s is matched to the mid-point velocity of its closest-point-projection, yielding the following expression [6]:  (32)         where the (time-independent) isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection are computed at the mid-point configuration.  Using a mid-point rule time integration, (32) yields  (33)            Note that, for the dynamic case, it is not possible to get an algorithm simultaneously satisfying discrete energy and angular momentum conservation [6]. The contact constraint (32) yields a discrete energy conservation algorithm, but the discrete angular momentum is not satisfied. Alternatively, imposing that the mid-point position of the slave node s has to be equal to the mid-point position of its closest-point-projection, would yield a discrete momentum conservation algorithm, but then the discrete energy conservation would not be satisfied [6].  Let us denote as   f   s , n + \u03b1   the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s at time n + \u03b1 , and   f   m , n + \u03b1   the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the master element at time n + \u03b1 , where \u03b1=1 for the quasi-static case and \u03b1=1/2 for the dynamic case. Applying the virtual work principle to the discrete contact force vectors   f   s , n + \u03b1   and   f   m , n + \u03b1   reads  (34)  \u03b4   u   s   \u22c5   f   s , n + \u03b1   + \u03b4   u   m   \u22c5   f   m , n + \u03b1   = 0   where \u03b4   u   s   and \u03b4   u   m   are virtual displacements of the slave and master element nodes, such that, taking into account that the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection remain constant, yields  (35)            Substituting (35) into (34) yields  (36)            For a quasi-static or dynamic frictional contact problem, the discrete residual force vectors can be written as  (37)    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  \u2212   f   s , n + \u03b1   = 0   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1    )  \u2212   f   m , n + \u03b1   = 0   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1    )  = 0   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1    )  = 0   where n + \u03b1 = n + 1 for a quasi-static case and n + \u03b1 = n + 1 / 2 for a dynamic case.  From (37)1 , the discrete contact force vector acting on a slave node s at time n + \u03b1 can be written as  (38)         and substituting (38) into (36), and then (36) into (37)2 , yields  (39)    r   m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   ,   u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  : =   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1    )  +   N  T    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  = 0   r   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1    )  : =   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1    )  = 0   r   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1    )  : =   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1    )  = 0      Using an incremental iterative Newton\u2013Raphson solution scheme, taking into account that the closest-point-projection remains constant, the linearization of the above expressions takes the form  (40)       r   m    (    u   m , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   s , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k + 1    )  : =   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k    )  +   N  T    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )       + D   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   + D   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g m , n + 1   k        +   N  T  D   g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   s , n + 1   k   +   N  T  D   g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g s , n + 1   k   = 0       r   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k + 1    )  =   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k    )       + D   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   s , n + 1   k   + D   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g s , n + 1   k        + D   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g 1 , n + 1   k   = 0       r   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k + 1   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k + 1    )  =   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k    )       + D   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   + D   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g m , n + 1   k        + D   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k    )  \u22c5 \u0394   u   g 2 , n + 1   k   = 0      and using the notation introduced in (28) and (33)2 , yields the following linearized system of equations:  (41)      (    K   m , m , n + 1   k   +   N  T    K   s , s , n + 1   k   N  )  \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   +   K   m , g m , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g m , n + 1   k   +   N  T    K   s , g s , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g s , n + 1   k        = \u2212   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k    )  \u2212   N  T    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )        K   g s , s , n + 1   k   N \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   +   K   g s , g s , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g s , n + 1   k   +   K   g s , g 1 , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g 1 , n + 1   k        = \u2212   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1   k    )        K   g m , m , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   +   K   g m , g m , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g m , n + 1   k   +   K   g m , g 2 , n + 1   k   \u0394   u   g 2 , n + 1   k        = \u2212   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g m , n + 1   k   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1   k    )          From an implementation point of view, starting from the global system of equations given in (30), the transformations of the global tangent stiffness matrix (GSM) and residual force vector (RFV) needed to implement the direct elimination method for the full stick frictional contact problem can be summarized in the following steps, which have to be carried out for each slave node s:   Step 1. Pre-multiply row s of the GSM by the matrix   N  T  .   Step 2. Add row s to row m of the GSM.   Step 3. Post-multiply column s of the GSM by the matrix N.   Step 4. Add column s to column m of the GSM.   Step 5. Set to zero matrix the row s, column s of the GSM.   Step 6. Enter a diagonal matrix   \u03b2   n + 1   k   =   \u03b2   n + 1   k    1 in the row s, column s of the GSM.   Step 7. Add the vector   N  T    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  to the row s of the RFV.  The diagonal matrix \u03b2 = \u03b2  1 , introduced in the row s, column s of the GSM in order to avoid the ill-conditioning (zero terms in the main diagonal) of the GSM, is defined as  (42)    \u03b2   n + 1   k   =  1    n   dim      (  1 \u2297 1  )  :   K   s , s , n + 1   k   =   \u03b2   n + 1   k    1 ,    \u03b2   n + 1   k   =  1    n   dim     1 :   K   s , s , n + 1   k   =  1    n   dim     tr  [    K   s , s , n + 1   k    ]    where tr  [ \u22c5 ]  denotes the trace operator and   n   dim   is the number of dimensions of the problem.  The resulting global linearized system of equations for the full stick frictional contact case can be written in matrix form as  (43)    [      \u03b2 1    0   0   0   0   0     0      K   g s , g s         K   g s , g 1         K   g s , s   N    0   0     0      K   g 1 , g s         K   g 1 , g 1      0   0   0     0      N  T    K   s , g s      0      K   m , m   +   N  T    K   s , s   N       K   m , g m      0     0   0   0      K   g m , m         K   g m , g m         K   g m , g 2        0   0   0   0      K   g 2 , g m         K   g 2 , g 2        ]   n + 1   k     \u00d7 [      \u0394   u   s         \u0394   u   g s         \u0394   u   g 1         \u0394   u   m         \u0394   u   g m         \u0394   u   g 2        ]   n + 1   k    = \u2212   [     0        g   g s           g   g 1           g   m   +   N  T    g   s           g   g m           g   g 2        ]   n + 1   k       Remark 1 Note that block-symmetry of the resulting global tangent stiffness matrix for the full stick friction case is preserved.  Once the resulting incremental iterative problem has been solved, the slave and master displacements are updated according to the following expressions.  For a quasi-static problem, the update of the master and slave displacements takes the form  (44)    u   m , n + 1   k + 1   =   u   m , n + 1   k   + \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k     u   s , n + 1   k + 1   =   x   s , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212   X   s   = N   x   m , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212   X   s   = N   u   m , n + 1   k + 1   + N   X   m   \u2212   X   s        For a dynamic problem, using a discrete linear momentum and energy conserving algorithm, the update of the master and slave and displacements takes the form  (45)    u   m , n + 1   k + 1   =   u   m , n + 1   k   + \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k     u   s , n + 1   k + 1   =   u   s , n + 1   k   + \u0394   u   s , n + 1   k   =   u   s , n + 1   k   + N \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k        For the dynamic case, once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been updated, the nodal velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19).  Once the slave and master nodes have been updated, the contact status at time n + \u03b1 has to be verified, checking out if the contact is still active or not. The contact will be still active if the contact normal force   f     N   n + \u03b1     : =   f   s , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   satisfies the following condition:  (46)    f     N   n + \u03b1     : =   f   s , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   =   g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   \u2265 0      Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s has to be deactivated for the next time step.  Once contact penetration is detected, the position of the slave node s is subjected to the constraints arising from the frictionless contact condition. Note that, contrary to the full stick frictional case, for the frictionless case, the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection are not constant in time. For the sake of concreteness, only the 3D frictionless quasi-static and dynamic cases will be presented, being straightforward to particularize the formulation for 2D cases.  For a quasi-static case, the current position of the slave node s can be written in terms of the current position of the closest-point-projection, yielding the following expression:  (47)         where    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   \u2208  \u25a1 are the time-dependent current isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection at time n + 1 .  Taking the variation of (47) yields  (48)  \u0394   x   s , n + 1   =   N   n + 1   \u0394   x   m , n + 1   + \u0394   N   n + 1     x   m , n + 1   =   N   n + 1   \u0394   x   m , n + 1   +   N   \u03be , n + 1     x   m , n + 1    \u0394    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   +   N   \u03b7 , n + 1     x   m , n + 1    \u0394    \u03b7 \u00af    n + 1   \u0394   u   s , n + 1   =   N   n + 1   \u0394   u   m , n + 1   +   N   \u03be , n + 1     x   m , n + 1    \u0394    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   +   N   \u03b7 , n + 1     x   m , n + 1    \u0394    \u03b7 \u00af    n + 1     and taking into account that the covariant tangent vectors are given by   \u03c4   \u03be , n + 1   =   N   \u03be , n + 1     x   m , n + 1   and   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1   =   N   \u03b7 , n + 1     x   m , n + 1   (see Appendix A), (48)2 can be written as  (49)         where \u0394    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   , \u0394    \u03b7 \u00af    n + 1   are the contravariant components of the incremental slip of the closest-point-projection on the covariant tangent basis   \u03c4   \u03be , n + 1   ,   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1   .  Let us denote as   f   s , n + 1   the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s at time n + 1 , and   f   m , n + 1   the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the master element at time n + 1 . Applying the virtual work principle to the discrete contact force vectors   f   s , n + 1   and   f   m , n + 1   reads  (50)  \u03b4   u   s   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1   + \u03b4   u   m   \u22c5   f   m , n + 1   = 0   where \u03b4   u   s   and \u03b4   u   m   are the virtual displacements of the slave and master element nodes, such that, taking into account the variation of the isoparametric coordinates of the closest-point-projection, satisfy the following expression (see Appendix A):  (51)  \u03b4   u   s   =   N   n + 1   \u03b4   u   m   +   N   \u03be , n + 1     x   m    \u03b4  \u03be \u00af  +   N   \u03b7 , n + 1     x   m    \u03b4  \u03b7 \u00af  =   N   n + 1   \u03b4   u   m   +   \u03c4   \u03be , n + 1    \u03b4  \u03be \u00af  +   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1    \u03b4  \u03b7 \u00af    where   \u03c4   \u03be , n + 1   and   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1   are the covariant tangent vectors to the isoparametric coordinates of the master surface at the closest-point-projection.  Substituting (51) into (50), and taking into account that   \u03c4   \u03be . n + 1   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1   = 0 and   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1   = 0 , yields  (52)           Remark 2 Note that the two last terms on the right hand side of (49) represent the tangent relative displacement of the slave node with respect to the closest-point-projection, here naturally expressed in terms of the variations of the contravariant components of the isoparametric coordinates \u0394    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   and \u0394    \u03b7 \u00af    n + 1   and the covariant tangent vectors to the isoparametric coordinates   \u03c4   \u03be , n + 1   and   \u03c4   \u03b7 , n + 1   , evaluated at time n + 1 . Note that those tangent vectors span the tangent space at the closest-point-projection at time n + 1 , but they do not need to be orthonormal, not even orthogonal. Alternatively, the tangent space could be spanned by an orthonormal basis defined by orthogonal unit tangent vectors   \u03c4   1 , n + 1   and   \u03c4   2 , n + 1   at the closest-point-projection at time n + 1 . Then, (49) can be alternatively expressed as  Similarly, the constraints satisfied by the discrete contact force vectors   f   s , n + 1   and   f   m , n + 1   given by (52), can be written as  (54)            For the dynamic case, a discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy conserving algorithm is obtained, imposing that the normal component of the slave node at the mid-point configuration has to be equal to the normal component of the velocity of its closest-point-projection at the mid-point configuration, yielding  (55)         where   n   n + 1 / 2   is the outward unit normal to the closest-point-projection at the configuration at time n + 1 / 2 .  Using a mid-point time integration scheme, the normal velocity constraint given by (55) yields  (56)    x   s , n + 1   \u22c5   n   n + 1 / 2   =  (    x   s , n   +   N   n + 1 / 2    (    x   m , n + 1   \u2212   x   m , n    )   )  \u22c5   n   n + 1 / 2        Then, the mid-point velocity of the slave node s at time n + 1 / 2 , and the current placement and current increment of displacement of the slave node s at time n + 1 can be written as  (57)         where   \u03c4   1 , n + 1 / 2   and   \u03c4   2 , n + 1 / 2   are orthogonal unit tangent vectors to the master surface at the mid-point closest-point-projection at time n + 1 / 2 , and   v   s 1 , n + 1 / 2   and   v   s 2 , n + 1 / 2   are the components of the relative mid-point slip velocity of the slave node s along the unit tangent vectors   \u03c4   1 , n + 1 / 2   and   \u03c4   2 , n + 1 / 2   , respectively, and \u0394   u   s 1 , n + 1   and \u0394   u   s 2 , n + 1   are the components of the relative incremental slip displacement of the slave node s with respect to the closest-point-projection, along the orthogonal unit tangent vectors   \u03c4   1 , n + 1 / 2   and   \u03c4   2 , n + 1 / 2   , respectively.  Let us denote as   f   s , n + 1 / 2   the discrete contact force acting on the slave node s at time n + 1 / 2 , and   f   m , n + 1 / 2   the vector collecting the discrete contact forces acting on the nodes of the master element at time n + 1 / 2 . Applying the virtual work principle to the discrete contact force vectors   f   s , n + 1 / 2   and   f   m , n + 1 / 2   reads  (58)  \u03b4   u   s   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1 / 2   + \u03b4   u   m   \u22c5   f   m , n + 1 / 2   = 0   where \u03b4   u   s   and \u03b4   u   m   are virtual displacements of the slave node and master element nodes, respectively, such that,  (59)  \u03b4   u   s   =   N   n + 1 / 2   \u03b4   u   m   + \u03b4 \u0394   u   s 1     \u03c4   1 , n + 1 / 2   + \u03b4 \u0394   u   s 2     \u03c4   2 , n + 1 / 2        Substituting (59) into (58), and taking into account that for a frictionless case,   \u03c4   1 . n + 1 / 2   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1 / 2   = 0 and   \u03c4   2 , n + 1 / 2   \u22c5   f   s , n + 1 / 2   = 0 , yields  (60)            For either a quasi-static or dynamic frictional contact problem, the discrete system of equations can be written as  (61)    g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  \u2212   f   s , n + \u03b1   = 0   g   m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1    )  \u2212   f   m , n + \u03b1   = 0   g   g s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1   ,   u   g 1 , n + 1    )  = 0   g   g m    (    u   m , n + 1   ,   u   g m , n + 1   ,   u   g 2 , n + 1    )  = 0   \u03c4   1 , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   f   s , n + \u03b1   = 0   \u03c4   2 , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   f   s , n + \u03b1   = 0   where n + \u03b1 = n + 1 for the quasi-static case, and n + \u03b1 = n + 1 / 2 for the dynamic case.  From (61)1 , the discrete contact force vector acting on a slave node s at time n + \u03b1 can be written as  (62)            Substituting (62) into (60)1 , and then (60)1 into (61), yields  (63)    r

stiffness matrix (GSM) and residual force vector (RFV) needed to implement the direct elimination method for the frictionless contact problem can be summarized in the following steps which have to be carried out for each slave node s :   Step 1. Add to row m , column m of the GSM, the matrix   N   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , s , n + 1   k     N   n + \u03b1   k   .   Step 2. Add to row m , column g s of the GSM, the matrix   N   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , g s , n + 1   k   .   Step 3. Add to row m , column s of the GSM, the matrix   N   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , s , n + 1   k     H   n + \u03b1   k   +     A \u00af  \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   .   Step 4. Add to row g s , column m of the GSM, the matrix   K   g s , s , n + 1   k     N   n + \u03b1   k   .   Step 5. Add to row g s , column s of the GSM, the matrix   K   g s , s , n + 1   k     H   n + \u03b1   k   .   Step 6. Replace row s , column m of the GSM by the matrix   H   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , s , n + 1   k     N   n + \u03b1   k   +   A   n + \u03b1   T  k   .   Step 7. Add to row s , column g s of the GSM, the matrix   H   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , g s , n + 1   k   .   Step 8. Replace row s , column s of the GSM by the matrix   H   n + \u03b1   T  k     K   s , s , n + 1   k     H   n + \u03b1   k    +    A \u00af    n + \u03b1   k    +   \u03b2   n + 1   k     1   001   .   Step 9. Add to row m of the RFV, the vector   N   n + \u03b1   T  k      g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  .   Step 10. Replace row s of the RFV by   H   n + \u03b1   T  k      g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  .  where, at the row s of the global vector of unknowns, the vector \u0394   u   s , n + 1   k   has been conveniently replaced by the vector \u0394   u   s , n + 1   \u2032 k   collecting the tangential components of the incremental relative slip displacement of the slave node s, defined as \u0394   u   s , n + 1   \u2032 k   : =   [  \u0394   u   s 1 , n + 1   k   , \u0394   u   s 2 , n + 1   k   , 0  ]  T  , and, for the sake of compactness, the following matrices have been introduced (see Appendix A)  (67)    H   n + \u03b1   k    : =  [    \u03c4   1 , n + \u03b1   k   ,    \u03c4   2 , n + \u03b1   k   , 0  ]    A   n + \u03b1   k   : =  [  \u03b1    A   1 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  ,  \u03b1    A   2 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  , 0  ]     A \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   : =  [  \u03b1     A \u00af    1 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  ,  \u03b1     A \u00af    2 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  , 0  ]      A \u00af  \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   : =  [  \u03b1      A \u00af  \u00af    1 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  ,  \u03b1      A \u00af  \u00af    2 , n + \u03b1   T  k     g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   k   ,   u   g s , n + 1   k    )  , 0  ]    where  (68)      A \u00af  \u00af    1 , n + \u03b1   T  k   : =   N   \u03be , n + \u03b1   T  k     m   1 , n + \u03b1   \u03be  k   +   N   \u03b7 , n + \u03b1   T  k     m   1 , n + \u03b1   \u03b7  k       A \u00af  \u00af    2 , n + \u03b1   T  k   : =   N   \u03be , n + \u03b1   T  k     m   2 , n + \u03b1   \u03be  k   +   N   \u03b7 , n + \u03b1   T  k     m   2 , n + \u03b1   \u03b7  k     and   1   001   is a   n   dim   \u00d7   n   dim   matrix with zero entries everywhere, except a 1 entry in the diagonal position (    n   dim   ,   n   dim    ) . The matrix   \u03b2   n + 1   k      1   001   is added in order to avoid the ill-conditioning (zero terms in the main diagonal) of the system, where the scalar parameter   \u03b2   n + 1   k   is defined as  (69)    \u03b2   n + 1   k   =  1    n   dim     1 :   K   s , s , n + 1   k   =  1    n   dim     tr  [    K   s , s , n + 1   k    ]    where tr  [ \u22c5 ]  denotes the trace operator and   n   dim   is the number of dimensions of the problem.  Note that, following this procedure, the number of equations of the system is kept constant. Once convergence has been achieved, the increment of displacements \u0394   u   s , n + 1   is computed in terms of \u0394   u   m , n + 1   and \u0394   u   s , n + 1   \u2032   using either (53), for the quasi-static case, or (57)3 , for the dynamic case.  The resulting global linearized system of equations for the frictionless contact case can be written in matrix form as  (70)    [        H   T     K   s , s   H +  A \u00af  + \u03b2   1   001         H   T     K   s , g s      0      H   T     K   s , s   N +   A  T     0   0        K   g s , s   H       K   g s , g s         K   g s , g 1         K   g s , s   N    0   0     0      K   g 1 , g s         K   g 1 , g 1      0   0   0        N   T     K   s , s   H +   A \u00af  \u00af        N  T    K   s , g s      0      K   m , m   +   N  T    K   s , s   N       K   m , g m      0     0   0   0      K   g m , m         K   g m , g m         K   g m , g 2        0   0   0   0      K   g 2 , g m         K   g 2 , g 2        ]   n + 1   k     [      \u0394   u   s   \u2032         \u0394   u   g s         \u0394   u   g 1         \u0394   u   m         \u0394   u   g m         \u0394   u   g 2        ]   n + 1   k   = \u2212   [        H   T     g   s           g   g s           g   g 1           g   m   +   N  T    g   s           g   g m           g   g 2        ]   n + 1   k     where note that the matrices N , H , A ,  A \u00af  ,   A \u00af  \u00af  are evaluated at the configuration n + \u03b1 , as indicated in (66)\u2013(68). Remark 3 Note that, contrary to what happens for the full stick friction case, block-symmetry of the resulting global tangent stiffness matrix for the frictionless case is lost due to the contributions of the matrices   A   n + \u03b1   k   ,    A \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   ,     A \u00af  \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   given in (67). Matrices   A   n + \u03b1   k   and    A \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   arise from the variation of the orthogonal unit tangent vectors   \u03c4   1 , n + \u03b1   k   and   \u03c4   2 , n + \u03b1   k   and note that   A   n + \u03b1   k   \u2260    A \u00af    n + \u03b1   T  k   , while matrix     A \u00af  \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   arises from the variation of   N   n + \u03b1   k   in (65)1 . Note also that, for linear elements the matrix    A \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   = 0 (see Appendix A). Within an infinitesimal strain framework, those variations can be neglected and the block-symmetry of the resulting global tangent stiffness matrix can be preserved.  The displacements of the master nodes are updated according to the following expression:  (71)    u   m , n + 1   k + 1   =   u   m , n + 1   k   + \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k        The displacements of the slave nodes are updated according to the following procedure:   Step 1. Compute the current displacements and coordinates of the slave node at the iteration k + 1 of time n + \u03b1 , using the isoparametric coordinates    \u03be \u00af    n + \u03b1   k   of the closest-point-projection at the iteration k    (72)     u \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   =   u   s , n + 1   k   +   N   n + \u03b1   k   \u0394   u   m , n + 1   k   + \u0394   u   s 1 , n + 1   k     \u03c4   1 , n + \u03b1   k   + \u0394   u   s 2 , n + 1   k     \u03c4   2 , n + \u03b1   k      x \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   =   X   s   +    u \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1         Step 2. Update the isoparametric coordinates    \u03be \u00af    n + \u03b1   k + 1   of the closest-point-projection of the slave node at the iteration k + 1 as follows:  For the quasi-static case, the configuration n + \u03b1 is set equal to n + 1 , and    \u03be \u00af    n + 1   k + 1   is computed using the coordinates    x \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   of the slave node.  For the dynamic case, the configuration n + \u03b1 is chosen as the mid-point configuration, setting n + \u03b1 equal to n + 1 / 2 , and    \u03be \u00af    n + 1 / 2   k + 1   is computed using the coordinates    x \u00af    s , n + 1 / 2   k + 1   of the slave node defined as  (73)     x \u00af    s , n + 1 / 2   k + 1   =   1 2    (     x \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   +   x   s , n    )        Step 3. Update the current displacements of the slave node according to the following procedure:  For the quasi-static case, the current displacements of the slave node at the iteration k + 1 of time n + 1 are updated as  (74)    u   s , n + 1   k + 1   =   N   n + 1   k + 1     x   m , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212   X   s        For the dynamic case, the current displacements of the slave node at the iteration k + 1 of time n + 1 are updated as  (75)    u   s , n + 1   k + 1   =    x \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212 \u0394   g   N , n + 1 / 2   k + 1     n   n + 1 / 2   k + 1   \u2212   X   s     where,  (76)  \u0394   g   N , n + 1 / 2   k + 1   =  (     x \u00af    s , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212   x   s , n   \u2212   N   n + 1 / 2   k + 1    (    x   m , n + 1   k + 1   \u2212   x   m , n    )   )  \u22c5   n   n + 1 / 2   k + 1     such that, it is ensured that the discrete frictionless contact kinematic constraint given by (56) is satisfied, and the discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and energy are conserved.  For the dynamic case, once the displacements of the slave and master nodes have been updated, the nodal velocities of the slave and master nodes are updated using (19).  Once the displacements have been updated, the contact status has to be checked out in order to decide if it has to be keep as active or if it has to be deactivated for the next step. The contact will be still active if the contact normal force   f     N   n + \u03b1     : =   f   s , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   satisfies the following condition:  (77)    f     N   n + \u03b1     : =   f   s , n + \u03b1   \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   =   g   s    (    u   s , n + 1   ,   u   g s , n + 1    )  \u22c5   n   n + \u03b1   \u2265 0      Otherwise, contact is lost and the contact status for the slave node s has to be deactivated for the next time step.  The direct method proposed in this work is relatively easy to implement into a FE code. A detailed description of the matrix operations needed to be carrried out for the full stick frictional case and the frictionless case has been given above in a step-by-step procedure. The finite element formulation and direct elimination algorithm for quasi-static and dynamic analysis of full stick friction and frictionless contact problems have been implemented in an enhanced version of the finite element code for structural analysis RamSeries [48]. Fig. 2 shows a flow chart of the direct elimination algorithm for contact problems.  In this section a selection of representative quasi-static and dynamic numerical examples, that illustrate the performance of the contact formulation proposed, is shown. Three quasi-static and one dynamic numerical examples have been chosen.  First, a contact patch test is considered. An assessment of the error obtained using the direct elimination method, for different mesh sizes and different Young\u05f3s modulus, has been performed. In the second example, a Hertzian contact problem [23] is considered in order to make an assessment of the accuracy of the proposed contact model. Numerical results obtained using the direct elimination method, have been compared with analytical solutions [23]. The third example consists of a 3D axisymmetric punch indentation benchmark test. This is one of the benchmark tests presented by Konter [28] within the FENET EU Thematic Network Report called Advanced Finite Element Contact Benchmarks. Numerical results obtained for the 3D punch indentation benchmark test using the proposed contact formulation, have been compared with numerical results obtained with the commercial FE softwares Abaqus/Standard and MSC.MARC, using the penalty method [28]. The fourth example deals with the dynamic impact of two rigid cylinders. Here the goal is to show that the proposed formulation exhibits the conservation of the discrete linear momentum, angular momentum and total energy.  The numerical simulations have been performed using an enhanced version of the finite element program RamSeries [48] developed by COMPASS, a spin-off company of CIMNE.  It is well known that node-to-segment (NTS) formulations, such as the one shown in this work, do not satisfy the patch test. This example deals with the contact of two elastic blocks. An assessment of the error obtained using the direct elimination method, for different mesh sizes and different Young\u05f3s modulus, has been performed. Full stick frictional conditions have been considered. The mesh refinement is controlled by the number of divisions per unit of length of the mesh of the master surface, and the following two values of the ratio between the mesh sizes of the master and slave surfaces: 0.75 and 1.5. Two sets of values for the elastic Young\u05f3s modulus have been considered for both the slave and master bodies: 2.1E+11Pa and 5.0E+07Pa. Standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement hexahedral elements have been used. Fig. 3 shows the geometry, material properties and boundary conditions for the contact patch test.  The estimated error has been computed as  (78)  Error  ( % )  = 100     \u03c3   t r u e   \u2212   \u03c3   max  ,  min       \u03c3   t r u e       where   \u03c3   t r u e   = 100  Pa would be the exact value of the stress at the contact interface if the patch test would be verified, and   \u03c3   max  ,  min   is the value of the maximum or minimum stress (the one which is less close to the exact stress value) computed by the proposed method.    Fig. 4 shows the convergence to the exact solution of the contact pressure when the mesh is refined, for two values of the ratio between the master mesh size and the slave mesh size (0.75 and 1.50), and for four different sets of Young\u05f3s elastic modulus (2.11E+11Pa and 5.0E+07Pa) for the slave and master bodies. Results show that the convergence increases when the ratio between the master and slave mesh sizes increases. It is also shown that the convergence increases when the mechanical properties (Young\u05f3s elastic modulus) of the two bodies are similar.  In order to make an assessment of the accuracy of the proposed contact formulation, the Hertzian contact test between two elastic cylinders has been considered [23]. Numerical results obtained using the direct elimination method have been compared with analytical solutions [23]. Frictionless conditions have been assumed. Standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement hexahedral elements have been used. Symmetry conditions have been introduced and only a quarter of each one of the cylinders has been considered. The finite element mesh used for the discretization of the two cylinders consists of 3137 elements and 6438 nodes. The geometry, mesh and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 5.  Using the contact formulation proposed in this work, the computed width of the contact area, given by the position of the nodes of the last master element contacted, can be estimated that is within the following range of values:  (79)  0.67  mm \u2264   b   n u m   \u2264 0.71  mm      The exact width of the contact area can be computed analytically using the following expression:  (80)  b = 2   2 q   R  2    1 \u2212   \u03bd  2    \u03c0 E     = 0.681  mm   where R is the radius of the cylinder and q is the vertical pressure on the top. Therefore, the exact value of the contact width falls within the range of values computed numerically.  The exact distribution of the contact pressure can be computed analytically using the following expression:  (81)    t   N   =   t   N   max     1 \u2212  x b    ,    t   N   max   =     2 q E   \u03c0  (  1 \u2212   \u03bd  2   )        where   t   N   max   is the maximum contact normal pressure.    Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the numerical and the analytical results for the contact normal pressure. A very good agreement can be observed.  This example deals with a 3D punch indentation benchmark test [27]. An axisymmetric steel punch is applied on an aluminum cylinder. The height of the steel punch is 100mm and its radius is 50mm. The bottom corner of the punch is rounded with a radius of 10mm. The radius of the aluminum cylinder is 100mm and its height is 200mm. The elastic Young\u05f3s modulus of the steel punch and the aluminum cylinder are 2.1E+11Pa and 0.7E+11Pa, respectively. Poisson\u05f3s coefficient of both the steel punch and the aluminum cylinder is 0.3. An axial uniform normal pressure of 100MPa is applied on the top surface of the steel punch. Zero prescribed displacements are considered on the bottom surface of the aluminum cylinder. Frictionless conditions have been considered. Taking into account the axisymmetric nature of the problem, only a quarter of the geometry of the bodies has been considered, adding the corresponding symmetry conditions. Standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement hexahedral elements have been used. The finite element mesh used for the discretization of the punch and the cylinder consists of 7201 elements and 8386 nodes. Fig. 7 shows the finite element discretization of the 3D punch indentation benchmark test.  The numerical results obtained for the 3D punch indentation benchmark test using the proposed direct elimination contact formulation have been compared with numerical results obtained with the commercial FE softwares Abaqus/Standard and MSC.MARC, using the penalty method and standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement hexahedral elements [28].    Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the vertical displacement of the top surface of the aluminum cylinder as a function of the radial distance. Numerical results obtained in this work are compared with results obtained using the penalty method with Abaqus/Standard [28]. A very good agreement is shown.    Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the radial displacement of the top surface of the aluminum cylinder as a function of the radial distance. Numerical results obtained in this work are compared with results obtained using the penalty method with MSC.MARC [28]. Once again, a very good agreement is shown.    Fig. 10 shows the distribution of the contact normal pressure vs the radial distance at the top surface of the aluminum cylinder. Numerical results obtained in this work are compared with results obtained using the penalty method with MSC.MARC [28]. A very good agreement is shown except in the peak area, for a radius around 40mm, where some differences can be observed.  This example leads with the impact of two quasi-rigid cylinders sliding on a rigid surface. Frictionless contact conditions between the two cylinders and between each one of the cyinders and the sliding surface have been considered. The radius of the cylinders is 0.1m. Elastic Saint-Venant material models with Young\u05f3s elastic modulus 2.1E+09Pa and Poisson\u05f3s coefficient 0.3 have been considered. The mass density of the material is 2500kg/m3. Cylinder 1 has an initial velocity in the x-direction of 1.0m/sec.  The cylinders have been discretized using standard Galerkin P1 linear displacement tetrahedral finite elements. The finite element mesh used for the discretization of the two cylinders consists of 4672 elements and 1224 nodes. Fig. 11 shows the geometry, initial conditions and finite element meshes of the two cylinders. Time increments of 0.001 s have been considered.    Fig. 12 shows the evolution of the positions of the two cylinders at different time steps. Despite the fact that frictionless conditions have been considered, Fig. 12 shows that the cylinders rotate around their axes. This is an undesirable effect due to the finite element discretization of the cylinders. Unless an extremely fine mesh is used, the unit normal to the master surface at the closest-point-projection does not pass through the axis of the cylinder, leading to a moment when the cylinders come into contact. A similar effect can be found in the results shown in [5]. Despite those undesirable effects, the proposed contact model is able to conserve the discrete total linear momentum and angular momentum, and the total energy, as it is shown on  Figs. 13 and 14, respectively."}
