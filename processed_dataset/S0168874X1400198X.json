KEYPHRASES   Geometrically exact rods  Finite rotations  Momentum-conserving algorithms  Variational integrators   The formulation of continuum based theories for rods has captured the interest of researchers during decades [60]. The motivation for developing such theories is rooted in attempting to model complex physical problems arising in the dynamics of slender solids by means of a dimensionally reduced approach. This point of view has boosted the construction of models depending on one spatial variable and the time [1,73].  One of the most successful models 1   1 An alternative to geometrically exact models is given by the co-rotational approach for rods, see for example [15]. for describing the dynamics of elastic rods undergoing finite deformation has been proposed by Simo in [65]. This geometrically exact formulation follows a director-type approach to describe the kinematics of the rods and corresponds to a three-dimensional generalization of Reissner\u05f3s original model [60,61]. In a posterior work, Simo and Vu-Quoc [69,70] proposed a numerical scheme based on combining the finite element method (FEM) with a modified version of Newmark\u05f3s scheme for time integration. Other authors have also made highlighting contributions. For example, an initially curved reference configuration for the rod has been considered in [31,32,37]. A total Lagrangian formulation has been proposed in [11] and revisited in [47]. Some important numerical issues such as the construction of non-locking elements or frame-indifferent formulations can be consulted in [8,35,62,63]. An alternative formulation based on some concepts of geometric (Clifford) algebra is presented in [58]. The list of works largely exceeds the mentioned ones, which only constitute some relevant examples; a more complete survey can be consulted in [53].  From the point of view of the applications, this formulation has also received considerable attention. In [72] Simo and Vu-Quoc applied the model to study the dynamics of earth-orbiting flexible satellites with multibody components. It has also been used for studying the dynamics of flexible mechanisms [7,10], robotic technology [78], the coupled geometric and constitutive nonlinear response of structures and buildings in the static [56] and dynamic cases [57], including applications to passive control in earthquake engineering [73,53]. The application of the model to the study of slender structures made of composite materials has been carried out in [75\u201377].  The formulation of time integrators for the Reissner\u2013Simo theory of elastic rods results to be a particularly challenging task since the model describes a dynamical system evolving on a nonlinear manifold rather than on a linear space. Several approaches have been proposed in order to design time integrators respecting the geometry of the configuration space. The design of structure-preserving algorithms for dynamics of rigid bodies is closely linked to the design of new methods for elastic rods. In this sense, Simo and Wong [71] developed a midpoint algorithm on SO ( 3 )   2   2 The symbol SO ( 3 ) denotes the non-commutative group of proper rotations [47]. which conserves the total energy and the norm of the total momentum. They also formulated an implicit energy and momentum conserving algorithm. In [70] Newmark\u05f3s method was extended to include SO ( 3 ) yielding to a scheme able to handle arbitrarily large rotations and displacements. Even though this scheme has demonstrated to be useful in several applications [11], M\u00e4kinen states [46] that it only constitutes an approximated version of the correct formulas, which are given in [2].  In spite of the above results, it is widely recognized that Newmark\u05f3s family of implicit schemes fails to preserve the invariants of nonlinear Hamiltonian systems with symmetry [68]. Moreover, the stability and accuracy properties are not guaranteed in the nonlinear range [3,4]. A further step towards the development of robust schemes is given by formulation of the so-called the energy and momentum conserving (E\u2013M) methods. They have been extended to elastic rods by Simo et al. in [67]. An alternative to E\u2013M methods is given by the symplectic-momentum methods which are characterized by the preservation of certain skew-symmetric bilinear form on the phase space 3   3 The simultaneous conservation of the total energy and the symplectic structure is not possible for methods with constant time step [36,41,22]. along with the exact conservation of the momenta associated to symmetries of the Lagrangian. A comparison between symplectic and E\u2013M schemes is presented in [24]. First-order accurate algorithms that exhibit controllable energy dissipation and momentum conservation are formulated in [3] and second-order methods can be found in [4].  More recently, the attention have been turned towards the so-called variational integrators (VI) which are methods obtained from a discrete version of Hamilton\u05f3s principle for conservative systems [51,52,59,79]. These methods present remarkable properties among which are: (i) they are symplectic, (ii) they exactly conserve the momenta associated to the symmetries of a discrete Lagrangian and (iii) they show an excellent long time energy behavior. Moreover, higher order methods can be constructed following a systematic procedure. An overview of the method can be found in [44] and the case of continuum systems in considered in [49,81]. The construction of asynchronous VI\u05f3s is carried out in [43] and development of generalized Galerkin VI\u05f3s, including dynamical systems evolving on Lie groups, can be consulted in [41,39,40]. In summary, variational methods constitute an extraordinarily versatile framework for the systematic construction of structure-preserving time integrators [29] that can be applied to a wide variety of problems arising in different fields of science and engineering [41,55]. However, the variational techniques have not been applied to formulate structure-preserving methods for geometrically exact rods.  Innovative numerical models of elastic rods are currently used in a wide range of subjects areas such as computational biophysics, the dynamics of interacting biomolecules and filaments, synthetic polymers and new materials based on nano-technologies. For example, in [38] a numerical model for the dynamics of viscous Kirchhoff rods is used for studying problems of biological significance, including the super-coiling and instability in closed rods and the self-assembly behavior of fibril structures such as certain types of bacteria. Goriely and Tabor [25\u201327] study certain theoretical aspects of Kirchhoff\u05f3s rods with applications in the numerical simulation of thin filaments. The application of rod models to the study the growth of certain plants can be consulted in [28]. In [23] a theory of elastic filaments is extended to consider biological systems that display competition between two helical structures of opposite chirality. Balaeff et al. [6] extend the classical Kirchhoff\u05f3s model applied to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to account for sequence-dependent intrinsic twist and curvature, anisotropic rotational stiffness and electrostatic interactions. Yang et al. [80] construct a finite element (FE) model for inextensible elastic rods including self-contact and use it for modelling a DNA polymer composed of thousands of base pairs. A survey about the numerical modelling of super-helical DNA can be consulted in [64]. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate robust time integrators for simulating the dynamics of rods undergoing complex morphological changes.  In this work, a new explicit variational integrator for simulating the dynamics of geometrically exact rods is formulated. Its construction is built on the simultaneous discretization in space and time of the action functional. To this end, the finite element method is applied the continuum problem to obtain a finite-dimensional semi-discrete problem. Then, standard procedures in variational integration are applied on the nodal variables of the mesh to formulate a structure-preserving Lie-group partitioned Runge\u2013Kutta method. The new time integrator enjoys a number of remarkable features: (i) it is explicit if an appropriate quadrature rule is used to compute the discrete kinetic energy, (ii) it is symplectic, (iii) it exactly conserves the momenta associated to the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian, (iv) it is second-order accurate, (v) it shows an energy drift that remains bounded over exponentially long periods of times and, (vi) since it is explicit, it avoids using iterative schemes to solve large systems of nonlinear equations.  In this section the Lagrangian point of view of the mechanics is considered to deduce the balance equations for geometrically exact rods in finite deformation. Special emphasis is given to the non-linear nature of the configuration manifold. Additionally, the Hamiltonian structure of the problem is also addressed along with the invariants of the dynamics.   Kinematics: Let {   E   i   } and {   e   i   } be the material and spatial inertial frames, which are orthogonal and coincident. 4   4 Notation: Latin and Greek indexes range over {1,2,3} and {2,3}, respectively. The symbols ( \u2022 )   ,   x   ,   ( \u2022 )   \u0307   and SO ( 3 ) denote differentiation with respect to x, time differentiation and the linear space of skew-symmetric tensors, respectively. The reference configuration is given by a straight rod of length L with constant cross section A \u2282   R   2   . Then, the position vector of a material point in this configuration is   X ( s ,   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ) = s   E   1   +   \u03be   1     E   1   +   \u03be   2     E   2   ,   where s \u2208 [ 0 , L ] is an arch-length coordinate and (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ) \u2208 A are coordinates on the cross section. The reference curve   \u03c6   0   is defined as the geometric place of all the points of the form X ( s , 0 , 0 ) . The position vector of a material point in the current configuration is given by  (1)  x ( s ,   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ) = \u03c6 ( s ) +   \u03be   1     t   1   ( s ) +   \u03be   2     t   2   ( s ) ,   where the spatial curve \u03c6 : [ 0 , L ] \u2192   R   3   is obtained by adding a displacement onto   \u03c6   0   and the vectors   t   i   = \u039b   E   i   with \u039b : [ 0 , L ] \u2192 SO ( 3 ) define an orthonormal coordinate system characterizing the current orientation of the cross-section [65,37], see Fig. 1 .  The configuration space, Q , is the set of all the smooth-enough fields  (2)  \u03a6 \u2261 ( \u03c6 , \u039b ) : [ 0 , L ] \u2192   R   3   \u00d7 SO ( 3 ) ,   subjected to the prescribed boundary conditions \u03a6 ( 0 ) =   \u03a6   0   and \u03a6 ( L ) =   \u03a6   L   and to the restriction \u03c6   ,   s   \u00b7   t   1   > 0  [67]. Due to the non-commutative nature of SO ( 3 ) , Q results to be a nonlinear differentiable manifold [50,68]. Thereby, using the spatial rule to update rotations, we obtain that admissible variations on \u03a6 \u2208 Q are given by elements of the form ( u ,   \u03b8   \u02dc   \u039b ) \u2208   T   \u03a6   Q where  (3)  ( u ,   \u03b8   \u02dc   ) : [ 0 , L ] \u2192   R   3   \u00d7 so ( 3 ) .   If we consider a time interval of interest [ 0 , T ] , a motion of the rod is given by a curve \u03a6 ( \u00b7 ) : [ 0 , T ] \u2192 Q . The corresponding velocity is   \u03a6   \u0307   = (   \u03c6   \u0307   ,   \u039b   \u0307   ) which yields to the following expression for the velocity of a material point:  (4)    x   \u0307   =   \u03c6   \u0307   + \u039b   V   \u02dc   Z =   \u03c6   \u0307   +   v   \u02dc   z ,   where Z =   \u03b2   2     E   2   +   \u03b2   3     E   3   and  (5)    V   \u02dc   =   \u039b   t     \u039b   \u0307   ,   is the material form of the angular velocity tensor. The corresponding spatial forms are z = \u039b Z and   v   \u02dc   = \u039b   V   \u02dc     \u039b   t   .   Strains: The material form of the cross sectional strain measures [37,66] are the strain vector, \u0393 =   \u039b   t   \u03c6   ,   s   \u2212   E   1   ,, and the curvature tensor   \u03a9   \u02dc   =   \u039b   t   \u039b   ,   s   . The corresponding spatial forms are given by \u03b3 = \u039b \u0393 and   \u03c9   \u02dc   = \u039b   \u03a9   \u02dc     \u039b   t   , respectively.   Stresses: It will be assumed that the rod is made of an isotropic, homogeneous, hyper-elastic material and that {   t   \u03b2   } are oriented along principal axes of the cross section. Following previous works [32,33,65,67], we consider a stored energy function per unit of reference length \u03c8 ( \u0393 , \u03a9 ) such that the material form of the stress resultants and stress couples are given by  (6)    n   m   =   \u2202 \u03c8 ( \u0393 , \u03a9 )   \u2202 \u0393   =   C   \u0393   \u0393  and    m   m   =   \u2202 \u03c8 ( \u0393 , \u03a9 )   \u2202 \u03a9   =   C   \u03a9   \u03a9 ,   where \u03a9 is the axial vector of   \u03a9   \u02dc   and,   C   \u0393   and   C   \u03a9   are the following cross sectional constitutive tensors:     C   \u0393   = diag [ EA ,  GA ,  GA ]  and    C   \u03a9   = diag [ GJ ,    EI   2   ,    EI   3   ] ,   where A is the cross sectional area and E, G, J, I 2 and I 3 are an elastic modulus, a shear modulus, a torsional stiffness and two flexural stiffnesses, respectively. The corresponding spatial forms are n = \u039b   n   m   , m = \u039b   m   m      The Lagrangian point of view of the mechanics is based on variational principles [51]. Often, it is preferred over other approaches due to its potential in the development of computational applications [20,36,39\u201341,43,44]. Basically, this approach consists in constructing the Lagrangian function of the system and then using Hamilton\u05f3s variational principle to deduce the equations of motion. Hamilton\u05f3s principle states that the trajectory of the system is a critical point of the action computed on the space of trajectories joining two fixed points on the configuration space. See [81] for a recent survey in the context of elasticity. In this section, this procedure is carried out for geometrically exact elastic rods.   Kinetic energy: The kinetic energy, K : T Q \u2192 R , is given by  (7)  K ( \u03a6 ,   \u03a6   \u0307   ) =   1   2     \u222b   0   L   (    A   \u03c1     \u03c6   \u0307   \u00b7   \u03c6   \u0307   \u2212 Tr [   V   \u02dc     E   \u03c1     V   \u02dc   ]  )  ds ,   where the cross sectional mass density   A   \u03c1   and the cross sectional material tensor   E   \u03c1   are given by  (8)    A   \u03c1   =   \u222b   A     \u03c1   0    dA  and    E   \u03c1   =   \u039b   t   (    \u222b   A     \u03c1   0   z \u2297 z  dA  ) \u039b ,   respectively.   Potential energy: We assume that the potential energy, U : Q \u2192 R , is given by the sum of two components according to   U ( \u03a6 ) =   U   int   ( \u03a6 ) +   U   ext   ( \u03a6 ) ,   where   U   int   ,   U   ext   : Q \u2192 R are given by  (9a)    U   int   ( \u03a6 ) =   \u222b   0   L   \u03c8 ( \u0393 , \u03a9 )  ds ,      (9b)    U   ext   ( \u03a6 ) = \u2212   \u222b   0   L     w   ext   ( \u03c6 , \u039b )  ds ,   where   w   ext   ( \u03a6 ) is a potential function for the loads applied on the system. Simo et al. [67] demonstrated that if   w   ext   is left invariant under the action of rotations, then necessarily   U   ext   ( \u03a6 ) =   U   ext   (   \u039b   t   \u03c6 ) .   Hamilton\u05f3s principle: The Lagrangian function L : T Q \u2192 R is constructed as the kinetic minus the potential energy of the system [50], i.e.,  (10)  L ( \u03a6 ,   \u03a6   \u0307   ) = K (   \u03a6   \u0307   ) \u2212 U ( \u03a6 ) .      Moreover, we consider the set C composed by all the smooth enough motions \u03a6 : [ 0 , T ] \u2192 Q and we construct the action functional S : C \u2192 R as  (11)  S [ \u03a6 ( \u00b7 ) ] =   \u222b   0   T   L ( \u03a6 ,   \u03a6   \u0307   )  dt .   Hamilton\u05f3s principle states that the trajectory followed by the system is a stationary point of the action under all variations in C that leaves fixed the end points \u03a6 ( 0 ) = \u03a6 ( T ) = 0 . Due to the non-linear nature of C computing \u03b4 S = 0 results to be a non-trivial task [69] which yields to the following Euler\u2013Lagrange equations:  (12a)    A   \u03c1       d   2       dt   2     \u03c6 == n   ,   s   + N ,      (12b)    d   dt   (  skew [   i   \u03c1   v ]  ) =   m   \u02dc     ,   s   +   \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   s     n   \u02dc   \u2212   n   \u02dc     \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   s   +   M   \u02dc   ,   which have to be supplemented with adequate initial conditions. In the above equations   i   \u03c1   is the spatial form of the inertial tensor, N a vector of the external forces and   M   \u02dc   a skew-symmetric tensor of external moments. The details to obtain (12a) and (12b) are omitted here but given in the accompanying Appendix. Alternatively, (12b) can be given in terms of axial vectors as  (13)    d   dt   (   i   \u03c1   v ) = m   ,   s   + \u03c6   ,   s   \u00d7 n + M .      Hamiltonian mechanics [50] provides an alternative framework to study the dynamics of geometrically exact rods [17]. However, it has been less considered in the literature. Notable exceptions are [9,45] where energy-momentum algorithms are developed. In this section we present some basic concepts in Hamiltonian mechanics in order to deduce Hamilton\u05f3s equations for elastic rods along with the invariants of the dynamics.   Legendre transforms: Momentum densities ( p ,   \u03c0   \u02dc   ) : [ 0 , L ] \u2192   R   3   \u00d7 SO ( 3 ) are introduced by mean of the following Legendre transforms:  (14a)    \u222b   0   L   p \u00b7 \u03b4   \u03c6   \u0307    ds =      d   d \u03f5   L (  \u2026 ,     \u03c6   \u0307     \u03f5   , \u2026  )  |   \u03f5 = 0   =   \u222b   0   L     A   \u03c1     \u03c6   \u0307   \u00b7 \u03b4   \u03c6   \u0307    ds ,      (14b)    \u222b   0   L   Tr [ \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     \u0307     \u03c0   \u02dc   ]  ds =      d   d \u03f5   L (  \u2026 ,     \u039b   \u0307     \u03f5   , \u2026  )  |   \u03f5 = 0   =   \u222b   0   L   Tr [  \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     \u0307    skew [   i   \u03c1   v ]  ]  ds ,   from which it is clear that p =   A   \u03c1     \u03c6   \u0307   and   \u03c0   \u02dc   = skew [   i   \u03c1   v ] . Note that ( \u03c6 , \u039b , p ,   \u039b   t     \u03c0   \u02dc   ) belongs to the co-tangent bundle   T   \u204e   Q . Alternatively, it is possible to consider the axial vector \u03c0 =   i   \u03c1   v  [68,67].   Hamilton\u05f3s equations: Rewriting the kinetic energy in terms of ( p , \u03c0 ) it is possible to define the Hamiltonian function H :   T   \u204e   Q \u2192 R as   H ( p , \u03c0 , \u03a6 ) = K ( p , \u03c0 ) + U ( \u03a6 ) =   1   2     \u222b   0   L   (    A   \u03c1   \u2212 1   p \u00b7 p +   i   \u03c1   \u2212 1   \u03c0 \u00b7 \u03c0  )  ds + U ( \u03a6 ) .   Moreover, following standard procedures in classical mechanics (see e.g. [48,66]) Hamilton\u05f3s equations are obtained as  (15a)    \u03c6   \u0307   =   A   \u03c1   \u2212 1   p ,      (15b)    \u039b   \u0307   = skew [   i   \u03c1   \u2212 1   \u03c0 ] \u039b ,      (15c)    p   \u0307   = n   ,   s   + N ,      (15d)      \u03c0   \u02dc     \u0307   =   m   \u02dc     ,   s   +   \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   s     n   \u02dc   \u2212   n   \u02dc     \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   s   +   M   \u02dc   .   Note that (15d) can be replaced by   \u03c0   \u0307   = m   ,   s   + \u03c6   ,   s   \u00d7 n + M .   Conserved quantities: In virtue of Noether\u05f3s theorem [50] there exist as many conserved quantities as symmetries of the Lagrangian. In the present case, the following conserved quantities are identified:  (i) The Lagrangian of system is autonomous and therefore, invariant under translations in time. This property yields to the conservation of energy which may easily verified by computing     H   \u0307   = 0 ,   after considering (15a) to (15d).  The Lagrangian is invariant under rigid body translations and rotations in space. The conserved quantities associated to these symmetries are the total linear momentum,   L   t   , and total angular momentum,   J   t   , which are given by  (16)    L   t   =   \u222b   0   L   p  ds  and    J   t   =   \u222b   0   L   (  \u03c6 \u00d7 p + \u03c0  )  ds .   The above quantities are conserved by the dynamics if the external loading is self-equilibrated and the prescribed boundary conditions are of the Neumann type [51,49,67,66].  In this section a second-order accurate time integrator for finite element discretizations of geometrically exact rods is formulated. We follow a standard methodology in variational integration to construct algorithms that automatically enjoy a number of remarkable properties: (i) they are symplectic, (ii) they exactly preserve the momenta associated to symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian, (iii) they show an excellent long term energy stability, and (iv) they preserve the geometric structure of the configuration manifold of the problem [43,44,51,52].  The discretization in space of the continuum problem is carried out with the help of the finite element method. We consider a partition   T   h   of the domain [ 0 , L ] in   N   e   non-overlapping elements. The resulting mesh is characterized by the length h of the largest finite element. On each element,   I   e   , a local one-dimensional finite element space   P   m   (   I   e   ) of polynomial functions of degree m \u2265 0 is defined.  The basic idea consist in approximating Q by means of a finite-dimensional subspace   Q   h   composed by elements of the form (   \u03c6   h   ,   \u039b   h   ) which are finite-dimensional approximations to ( \u03c6 , \u039b ) . In following, calculations are performed on the basis of a generic finite element   I   e   .  (i) We consider first the translational part of the motion. Then,   \u03c6   h   :   I   e   \u2192   R   3   is given by  (17)    \u03c6   h   ( s ) =   \u2211   a = 1     n   d       N   a   ( s )   \u03c6   a   ,  s \u2208   I   e   ,   where   \u03c6   a   = (   \u03c6   a   1   , \u2026 ,   \u03c6   a   3   ) is the position vector of the node a and   {   N   a   }   a = 1     n   d     is a set of Lagrangian basis functions for   P   m   (   I   e   )  [30].  It is worth noting that   \u03c6   h   ( s ) belongs to   R   3   for any value of s \u2208   I   e   since the nodal values   \u03c6   a   also belongs   R   3   . This is always the case when we are interpolating nodal variables that belong to a linear space. For example, if we know the nodal values of any skew-symmetric tensor,     w   \u02dc     a   \u2208 SO ( 3 ) , such as the angular velocity or the curvature, we can construct     w   \u02dc     h   :   I   e   \u2192 SO ( 3 ) as  (18)      w   \u02dc     h   ( s ) =   \u2211   a = 1     n   d       N   a   ( s )     w   \u02dc     a   ,  s \u2208   I   e   .   In the general case, if the nodal variables do not belongs to a linear space, the above interpolation yields to approximations which do not belong to the same space as the nodal variables. This is the case with the rotational part of the motion as we explain below.  Since the rotation group is a non-linear manifold rather than a linear space, (17) cannot be applied. Therefore, in general, we have that  (19)    \u2211   a = 1     n   d       N   a   ( s )   \u039b   a   \u2209 SO ( 3 ) ,  s \u2208   I   e   .   To construct a geometrically consistent approximation for   \u039b   h   :   I   e   \u2192 SO ( 3 ) we do not apply the classical Rodrigues\u05f3s formula for the exponential map [15] since this operation does not provide a representation free of singularities for arbitrary rotations. Instead, we adopt the following procedure proposed in [63]:  \u2022 We consider a representation of the nodal values of the rotation tensors in terms of unit quaternions. 5   5 Theoretical aspect about unit quaternions can be consulted e.g. in [58,15]. This representation is unique for arbitrary rotations. The nodal values of the unit quaternions   {   q   a   }   a = 1     n   d     are obtained from   {   \u039b   a   }   a = 1     n   d     by means of applying the well known Spurrier\u05f3s algorithm [74].  The nodal values of the rotation vectors   {   \u03a6   a   }   a = 1     n   d     are extracted from   {   q   a   }   a = 1     n   d     with the help of the procedure given in [69].  Since rotation vectors belong to a linear space,   \u03a6   h   ( s ) can be obtained by applying (17). Then,   q   h   ( s ) is computed following standard procedures (see e.g. [15, Chapter XVI]).  Finally,   \u039b   h   ( s ) is obtained from   q   h   ( s ) by applying the classical relation between rotation tensors and quaternions.  The construction of a semi-discrete counterpart of the Lagrangian functional (10) is build on the introduction of the FE interpolation of the (time-dependent) configuration variables (   \u03c6   h   ( t ) ,   \u039b   h   ( t ) ) in (7), (9a) and (9b) along with specifying appropriate quadrature rules to compute the corresponding volume integrals. Then, the semi-discrete kinetic energy   K   h   : T   Q   h   \u00d7 R \u2192 R and the internal and external components of the potential energy   U   int   ,   U   ext   :   Q   h   \u00d7 R \u2192 R are given by  (21a)    K   h   (   \u03a6   h   ( t ) ,     \u03a6   \u0307     h   ( t ) ) =   1   2     \u2211   i = 1     N   l       w   i   (    A   \u03c1     \u2225      \u03c6   \u0307     h   (   \u03be   i   , t )  \u2225   2   \u2212 Tr [      V   \u02dc     h   (   \u03be   i   , t )   E   \u03c1       V   \u02dc     h   (   \u03be   i   , t )  ]  ) ,      (21b)    U   h   int   (   \u03a6   h   , t ) =   \u2211   i = 1     N   g       w   i   \u03c8 (    \u0393   h   (   \u03be   i   , t ) ,   \u03a9   h   (   \u03be   i   , t )  ) ,      (21c)    U   h   ext   (   \u03a6   h   ) =   \u2211   i = 1     N   g       w   i     w   ext   (    \u03c6   h   (   \u03be   i   ) ,   \u039b   h   (   \u03be   i   )  ) ,   where   {   w   i   ,   \u03be   i   }   i = 1     N   l     ,   {   w   i   ,   \u03be   i   }   i = 1     N   g     are quadrature points and weights over [ 0 , L ] ,   \u0393   h   (   \u03be   i   ) =   \u039b   h   t   (   \u03be   i   )   \u03c6   h   ,   (   \u03be   i   )      s    \u2212   E   1   and     \u03a9   \u02dc     h   (   \u03be   i   ) =   \u039b   h   t   (   \u03be   i   )   \u039b   h   ,   (   \u03be   i   )      s    . The semi-discrete Lagrangian is then constructed as   L   h   =   K   h   \u2212   U   h   and the application of Hamilton\u05f3s principle allows to obtain the corresponding EL equations on the nodes of the mesh.  The values of the (semi-discrete) nodal momenta are computed with the help of the Legendre transform as  (22a)    p   a   ( t ) =   \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab       \u03c6   \u0307     b   ( t ) ,      (22b)      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   ( t ) =   \u2211   i = 1     N   l       w   i     N   a   (   \u03be   i   )  skew [    I   \u03c1   (   \u03be   i   )   V   h   (   \u03be   i   , t )  ] ,  a \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   n   d   } ,   where m is given in 51b,   I   \u03c1   is the material form of   i   \u03c1   and   V   h   the FE interpolation of the material form of the angular velocity vector. Semi-discrete counterpart of Hamilton\u05f3s Eqs. (15a)\u2013(15d) can also be deduced.  The time interval [ 0 , T ] is partitioned into N > 1 subintervals with constant time step \u0394 t = T / N , and we set   t   k   = kT / N , k = 0 , 1 , \u2026 , N . We denote by  (23)  (   \u03c6   a   k   ,   \u039b   a   k   ) ,  a \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   n   t   } ,   the approximation of the nodal values of the configuration variables, (   \u03c6   a   (   t   k   ) ,   \u039b   a   k   (   t   k   ) ) , and the procedures described in Section 3.1 are used to compute (   \u03c6   h   k   ( s ) ,   \u039b   h   k   ( s ) ) as the approximation to (   \u03c6   h   ( s ,   t   k   ) ,   \u039b   h   ( s ,   t   k   ) ) for all s \u2208   I   e   , \u2200   I   e   \u2282   T   h   .  The translational velocity is approximated by  (24)      \u03c6   \u0307     h   ( s , \u03c4 ) \u2248     \u03c6   h   k + 1   ( s ) \u2212   \u03c6   h   k   ( s )   \u0394 t   ,  ( s , \u03c4 ) \u2208   I   e   \u00d7 (   t   k   ,   t   k + a   ) ,   and time derivative of the rotational tensor by  (25)    \u039b   h   ( s , \u03c4 ) \u2248     \u039b   h   k + 1   ( s ) \u2212   \u039b   h   k   ( s )   \u0394 t   ,  ( s , \u03c4 ) \u2208   I   e   \u00d7 (   t   k   ,   t   k + a   ) .   Approximations (24) and (25), which are discontinuous across time interval boundaries, can be obtained following the standard methodology to construct Galerkin variational integrators (see e.g. [36,41,51,52]). Moreover, higher order methods can be systematically formulated by means of combining higher degree polynomials with higher order quadrature rules to compute the discrete Lagrangian. A complete analysis of Galerkin VI\u05f3s and their relation with Runge\u2013Kutta time integrators can be found in [43,79]. In [54] a fourth-order method for thermo-elastic problems is presented and the formulation of methods for dynamical problems evolving on Lie-group manifolds can be consulted in [41].   Discrete Lagrangian and discrete action sum: The fully discrete (in space and time) counterpart of the kinetics energy,   K   d   :   Q   h   \u00d7   Q   h   \u2192 R , is obtained by replacing     \u03c6   \u0307     h   by (24) and     \u039b   \u0307     h   by (25) in (21a) to obtain  (26)    K   d   =   1   2   ( \u0394 t )   2       \u2211   i = 1     N   l       w   i   (    A   \u03c1   \u2225   \u03c6   h   k + 1   (   \u03be   i   ) \u2212   \u03c6   h   k   (   \u03be   i   )   \u2225   2   + 2  Tr [  (  I \u2212   \u039b   h   ( k ) t   (   \u03be   i   )   \u039b   h   n + 1   (   \u03be   i   )  )   E   \u03c1    ]  ) .   Correspondingly, the discrete potential energy,   U   d   :   Q   h   \u2192 R , is given by  (27)    U   d   =   U   d   int   +   U   d   ext   =   \u2211   i = 1     N   g       w   i   (  \u03c8 (    \u0393   h   k   (   \u03be   i   ) ,     \u03a9   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   )  ) \u2212   w   ext   (    \u03c6   h   k   (   \u03be   i   ) ,   \u039b   h   k   (   \u03be   i   )  )  ) .      Moreover, we consider the scalar \u03b1 \u2208 [ 0 , 1 ] and apply the so-called generalized trapezoidal rule [52] to construct a discrete Lagrangian,  (28)    L   d   \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   0   ,   \u03a6   h   1   ) = \u0394 t (    K   d   (   \u03a6   h   0   ,   \u03a6   h   1   ) \u2212 \u03b1   U   d   (   \u03a6   h   0   ) \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )   U   d   (   \u03a6   h   1   )  ) ,   which is an approximation to the action functional on the time interval [   t   0   ,   t   1   ] . Remark It is worth noting that   L   d   1 / 2   is equivalent to the discrete Lagrangian obtained by means of using a two-point Gauss\u2013Lobbato quadrature rule in time to approximate     \u222b     t   0       t   1       L   h   (   \u03a6   h   ( t ) ,     \u03a6   \u0307     h   ( t ) )  dt .   The corresponding VI results to be a member of the standard Lobatto IIIA\u2013IIIB symplectic-partitioned Runge\u2013Kutta methods [52]. Moreover, it is possible to show that   L   d   1 / 2   is equivalent to the symmetric discrete Lagrangian     L   d   sym   =   \u0394 t   2   L (    \u03a6   h   0   ,     \u03a6   h   1   \u2212   \u03a6   h   0     \u0394 t    ) +   \u0394 t   2   L (    \u03a6   h   1   ,     \u03a6   h   1   \u2212   \u03a6   h   0     \u0394 t    ) ,   and therefore, according to [36, Theorem 3.1] the corresponding variational algorithm results to be a Lie group specialization of the classical Newmark\u05f3s method with \u03b2 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 / 2 (also known as central differences). However, the resulting method is explicit only if appropriate quadrature rules are used to compute (26) and (27). Details are given below  The discrete action sum is given by  (29)    S   d   \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   0   , \u2026 ,   \u03a6   h   N   ) =   \u2211   k = 0   N \u2212 1     L   d   \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   k   ,   \u03a6   h   k + 1   ) ,   which is an approximation to (11).   Discrete Hamilton\u05f3s principle and DEL equations: The discrete counterpart of Hamilton\u05f3s principle states that the evolution equations extremize (29) given fixed end points,   {   \u03a6   a   0   }   a = 1     N   t     and   {   \u03a6   a   N   }   a = 1     N   t     . Extremizing the action sum is equivalent to enforcing  (30)  \u03b4   S   d   \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   0   , \u2026 ,   \u03a6   h   N   ) = 0 ,   for arbitrary variations on the nodal values of the configuration variables   {   \u03a6   a   k   }   a = 1     N   t     and k \u2208 { 0 , \u2025 , N } . Details are given in the accompanying appendix (Section A.2).  Hamilton\u05f3s principle yields the discrete Euler\u2013Lagrange equations (DEL):  (31a)    \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab     (   \u03c6   b   k + 1   \u2212 2   \u03c6   b   k   \u2212   \u03c6   b   k \u2212 1   )     ( \u0394 t )   2     =   s   a   k   +   S   a   k   ,      (31b)      R   a   ( k ) t   \u2212   R   a   ( k \u2212 1 ) t   \u2212   R   a   k   +   R   a   ( k \u2212 1 )       ( \u0394 t )   2     =     h   \u02dc     a   k   +     H   \u02dc     a   k   ,  a \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   n   d   } ,   where m ,   s   a   k   and   S   a   k   are the mass matrix, the nodal value of the internal force vector and the nodal value of the externally applied force vector. Moreover,   R   a   k   ,     h   \u02dc     a   k   and     H   \u02dc     a   k   are the nodal values of the rotational inertia, the internal moment tensor and the externally applied moment tensor, respectively. Explicit expressions m ,   s   a   k   ,   S   a   k   ,   R   a   k   ,     h   \u02dc     a   k   and     H   \u02dc     a   k   are given in Appendix A.  Eqs. (31a) and (31b) (which do not depend on \u03b1) may be interpreted as the balance of translational forces and moments on each node of the mesh, respectively. They in fact provide a method to compute   \u03a6   a   k + 1   ( \u2200 a ) if we know   \u03a6   a   k   and   \u03a6   a   k \u2212 1   . If the body is subjected to non-conservative forces and moments, Lagrange\u2013D\u05f3Alembert principle can be used in deriving the modified DEL equations (see e.g. [36]).   Discrete Legendre transformations: Initial conditions are often given in terms of positions and momenta rather than in terms of two positions as required in (31a) and (31b). However, it is possible to rewrite the integrator in position-momentum form taking advantage of the discrete Legendre transform [43,44,52].  On one hand, we compute the translational momenta as follows:  (32a)    p   a   k   = \u2212   \u2207     \u03c6   a   k       L   d   \u03b1   =   \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab       \u03c6   b   k + 1   \u2212   \u03c6   b   k     \u0394 t   + \u03b1 \u0394 t (    s   a   k   +   S   a   k    ) ,      (32b)    p   a   k + 1   =   \u2207     \u03c6   a   k + 1       L   d   \u03b1   =   \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab       \u03c6   a   k + 1   \u2212   \u03c6   a   k     \u0394 t   \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u0394 t (    s   a   k + 1   +   S   a   k + 1    ) ,   for all a \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   n   d   } .  For the rotational part the following relation holds:   Tr [  \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k   ( \u2212   D     V   a   k       L   d   \u03b1   )  ] = Tr [  \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k     \u03c0   a   k    ] ,   with     \u03c0   a   k   = \u2212   D     V   a   k       L   d   \u03b1   = \u2212     R   a   k     \u0394 t   \u2212   \u03b1 \u0394 t   2   (      h   \u02dc     a   k   +     H   \u02dc     a   k    ) .   It is clear that (   D     V   a   k       L   d   \u03b1   +   \u03c0   a   k   ) has to be symmetric since \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k   is skew-symmetric and therefore, the nodal value of the rotational momentum     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   is given by  (33a)      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   =   \u03c0   a   k   \u2212   \u03c0   a   ( k ) t   =     R   a   ( k ) t   \u2212   R   a   k     \u0394 t   \u2212 \u03b1 \u0394 t (      h   \u02dc     a   k   +     H   \u02dc     a   k    ) ,   and     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k + 1   by  (33b)      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k + 1   =     R   a   ( k ) t   \u2212   R   a   k     \u0394 t   + ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ) \u0394 t (      h   \u02dc     a   k + 1   +     H   \u02dc     a   k + 1    ) .   Rearranging (32a) and (33a) allows to obtain the following updating scheme:  (34a)    \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab     \u03c6   b   k + 1   =   \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab     \u03c6   b   k   + \u0394 t (    p   a   k   \u2212 \u03b1 \u0394 t (    s   a   k   +   S   a   k    )  ) ,      (34b)    R   a   ( k ) t   \u2212   R   a   k   = \u0394 t (      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   + \u03b1 \u0394 t (      h   \u02dc     a   k   +     H   \u02dc     a   k    )  )   and subtracting (32a) from (32b) and (33a) from (33b), yields to the following relations:  (35a)    p   a   k + 1   =   p   a   k   \u2212 \u0394 t (    s   a   k + \u03b1   +   S   a   k + \u03b1    ) ,      (35b)      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k + 1   =     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   + \u0394 t (      h   \u02dc     a   k + \u03b1   +     H   \u02dc     a   k + \u03b1    ) ,   where   ( \u2022 )   a   k + \u03b1   = ( 1 \u2212 \u03b1 )   ( \u2022 )   a   k + 1   + \u03b1   ( \u2022 )   a   k   .   IMPLEMENTATION   The selection of specific quadrature rules to evaluate (21a)\u2013(21c) has important implications on the accuracy and on the computational cost of the resulting implementation (see e.g. [12, Chapter 4] or [18,14]). For example, using a Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature rule to evaluate the kinetic energy yields to a non-diagonal mass matrix preventing the formulation of explicit methods. In this work, we use one-dimensional Gauss\u2013Lobatto rules, with integration points located on the nodes of the element, to evaluate (21a). This choice allows the formulation of explicit methods and avoids computationally expensive tasks related to the iterative solution of large systems of nonlinear equations [9,33,62,70].  We select a Gauss\u2013Lobatto quadrature rule to evaluate (26) and a Gauss\u2013Legendre rule of the same order to evaluate (27). This selection yields to the following updating procedure for the nodal values of the configuration variables,  \u2022 The mass matrix (51b) becomes diagonal with entries   m   aa   =   m   a   =   w   a     A   \u03c1   . therefore, it is possible to update the nodal positions explicitly according to  (36)    \u03c6   a   k + 1   =   \u03c6   a   k   +   \u0394 t     m   a     (    p   a   k   \u2212 \u03b1 \u0394 t (    s   a   k   +   S   a   k    )  ) ,   where   m   a   ,   s   a   k   and   S   a   k   consider the contributions of all the elements sharing the node a [30].  Eq. (34b) simplifies to  (37)    \u039b   in ( a )   k     J   \u03c1 ( a )   k   \u2212   J   \u03c1 ( a )   k     \u039b   in ( a )   k ( t )   =   \u0394 t     w   a     (      \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   + \u03b1 \u0394 t (      h   \u02dc     a   k   +     H   \u02dc     a   k    )  ) ,   where   \u039b   in ( a )   k   =   \u039b   a   ( k ) t     \u039b   a   k + 1   is the nodal value of the incremental rotation tensor and   J   \u03c1 ( a )   k   is the nodal value of the characteristic tensor given in (43). Both of them as well as     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   consider the contribution of all the elements sharing the node a.  To determine   \u039b   in ( a )   k   we follow the method proposed by Lee et al. in [39]. It is based on using Rodrigues\u05f3s formula to parametrize the incremental rotation tensor in terms of an incremental rotation vector as     \u039b   in ( a )   k   = exp [  skew (    \u03b8   a   k    )  ] ,   Then, replacing the above expression in (37) the following nonlinear system of equations is obtained for each node of the mesh  (38)    sin   \u03b8   a   k       \u03b8   a   k     (    i   \u03c1 ( a )   k     \u03b8   a   k    ) +   1 \u2212 cos   \u03b8   a   k       (   \u03b8   a   k   )   2     (    \u03b8   a   k   \u00d7   i   \u03c1 ( a )   k     \u03b8   a   k    ) =   Y   a   k   ,   where \u03b8 = \u2225 \u03b8 \u2225 and   Y   a   k   is the axial vector of the right hand side of (37). The system (38) is solved with the help of the Newton\u2013Raphson scheme. Details about an efficient computational implementation can be consulted in [39].  Having obtained the current value of the incremental rotation vectors   {   \u03b8   a   k   }   a = 1     n   d     we compute   {   \u039b   in ( a )   k   }   a = 1     n   d     . Then, the update procedure for the nodal rotation tensors is given by  (39)    \u039b   a   k + 1   =   \u039b   in ( a )   k     \u039b   a   k   ,  a = 1 , \u2026 ,   n   d   .   Moreover, following the procedure described in Section 3.1 it is possible to compute   \u039b   h   k + 1   ( s ) , s \u2208   I   e   . The updated value of the translational strain vector and the curvature vector are computed according to [63].  The nodal momenta are updated with the help of (35a) and (35b). If initial data is given in terms of translational and angular velocity vectors, then Eqs. (22a) and (22b) are used to de compute   p   a   0   = p (   t   0   ) and     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   0   =     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   (   t   0   ) , respectively.  Using a Gauss\u2013Lobbato quadrature rule to compute (26) yields to an explicit method to update translational part of the configuration variables, (see (36)). However, to update the rotational part a non-linear system of equations has to be solved iteratively in every node of the mesh, (see (37) and (38)). It is irrespective of the quadrature rule used to compute (27).  A fundamental property of the Reissner\u2013Simo rod model is the frame invariance of the balance equations. However, as noted first in [16], most of the numerical approximations do not inherit this property, yielding to path-dependent solutions. This pathology is related to the method used to interpolate rotations from the nodes to the quadrature points. Different solutions have been proposed to correct this problem (see e.g. [8,9,35,62] among others). In the this work this aspect is not covered in great detail. However, we note that the interpolation procedure explained in Section 3.1 yields to path-independent solutions as it is shown in [63].  The resulting integration scheme is summarized in Algorithm 1. In the following its main properties are described. Algorithm\u00a01 Explicit algorithm for geometrically exact rods.       Data: Mesh:   T   h   , initial configuration:   {  (   \u03c6   a   0   ,   \u039b   a   0   )  }   a = 1     n   t     and initial boundary conditions:   {  (   p   a   0   ,   \u03a0   a   0   )  }   a = 1     n   t     .    forall the time instants t  k with k \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   N   t   }  do      |     forall  the  nodes  a \u2208 { 1 , \u2026 ,   n   t   }  do     |     Update    \u03c6   a   k + 1    with  the  help  of  ( 36 ) .     Update    \u039b   a   k + 1    according  to  ( 39 )  after  solving  ( 38 ) .     Update  (    p   a   k + 1   ,   \u03a0   a   k + 1    )  using  ( 35 a )  and  ( 35 b ) .         end          end          Order of accuracy with h: As it has been already explained, a Gauss\u2013Lobatto quadrature rule is selected to evaluate the volume integral appearing in the kinetic energy function. This option allows to formulate an explicit time integrator. Moreover, the entries of the lumped mass matrix are always positive. It is worth to mention that in this case the order of accuracy with the mesh size does not result affected by using a suboptimal quadrature rule. The reasons that explain this advantageous characteristic are the following:  \u2022 On one side, one-dimensional Gauss\u2013Lobbato quadrature rules of arbitrarily high order with positive weights are available [13].  On the other side, the following basic principle ensuring optimal convergence rate with h is automatically satisfied [21]:\u2014In each element, the quadrature rule must be exact for    P   2 ( k \u2212 m )   \u2014 where m is the highest differentiation order appearing in the energy expression (m=1).  Taking into account the above arguments, the highest order of accuracy with the mesh size is achieved when using a Gauss\u2013Lobatto quadrature rule. Error bounds for finite element interpolations of functions and an analysis of convergence of the finite element method can be reviewed e.g. in [5,12].   Order of accuracy with  \u0394 t : Marsden and West in [52, pp. 402] have proven that the order of accuracy of an algorithm in position-momentum form coincides with the order of accuracy of the discrete Lagrangian whenever it satisfies some standard smoothness conditions. In the cases of the discrete Lagrangian (28), if \u03b1 =    1   2    second-order of accuracy is obtained. The algorithm can be identified with a Lie-group version of the St\u00f6rmer\u2013Verlet scheme for finite element discretizations of geometrically exact rods. The same conclusion can be achieved after constructing the adjoint discrete Lagrangian defined as     L   d   \u204e \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   k   ,   \u03a6   h   k + 1   , \u0394 t ) = \u2212   L   d   \u03b1   (   \u03a6   h   k + 1   ,   \u03a6   h   k   , \u2212 \u0394 t ) .   Simple calculations indicate that the discrete Lagrangian (28) is self-adjoint i.e.   L   d   \u204e \u03b1   =   L   d   \u03b1   only if \u03b1 =    1   2    . Self-adjoint discrete Lagrangians derives in VI\u05f3s which are symmetric and have even order of accuracy (see [79, pp. 66 and 69]). Other values of \u03b1 \u2260    1   2    render only first-order accurate schemes.   Symplecticity and long term energy behavior: The Hamiltonian structure of the dynamics of geometrically exact rods ensures that the trajectories followed by the system conserve two important quantities: the total energy and the (skew-symmetric) symplectic two-form [50,66]. In the discrete case, variational methods automatically conserve a discrete analogue of the symplectic form (see e.g [44,49] for a proof). In what regards to the discrete total energy,  (40)    H   d   k   =   1   2     \u2211   a = 1     n   d     (    m   a   \u2212 1     p   a   k   \u00b7   p   a   k   +   I   \u03c1 ( a )   \u2212 1     \u03a0   a   k   \u00b7   \u03a0   a   k    ) +   U   d   (    \u03c6   1   k   , \u2026 ,   \u03c6     n   d     k   ,   \u039b   1   k   , \u2026 ,   \u039b     n   d     k    ) ,   its exact conservation is not possible for symplectic methods with constant time steps [36], however, a theorem in [29, pp. 312] allows us to ensure that the error in the total energy remains O (   h   p   ) (p being the order of accuracy the method) close to the original value for exponentially long periods of time if the provided time step is in the range of stability of the method. An equivalent result in the context of general Lie-group methods has been recently given in [19].   Invariants associated to symmetries of    L   d   \u03b1   : A discrete Lagrangian posses a symmetry when it remains invariant under the action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold. Moreover, according to a discrete version of Noether\u05f3s theorem (see e.g. [51,52]) each symmetry of the discrete Lagrangian leads to a quantity conserved by the dynamics. In our case,   L   d   \u03b1   results to be invariant under the action of rigid body translations and rotations. To verify this is enough to impose a rigid body rotation   Q   +   \u2208 SO ( 3 ) and a rigid body translation   c   +   \u2208   R   3   onto (   \u03a6   h   0   ,   \u03a6   h   1   ) \u2208   Q   h   \u00d7   Q   h   to yield   \u03a6   h   i +   = (    Q   +     \u03c6   h   i   +   c   +   ,   Q   +     \u039b   h   i    ) (i=0,1) and to check that  (41)    L   d   \u03b1   (    \u03a6   h   0   ,   \u03a6   h   1    ) =   L   d   \u03b1   (    \u03a6   h   0 +   ,   \u03a6   h   1 +    ) ,   which may be easily confirmed after replacing (   \u03a6   h   0 +   ,   \u03a6   h   1 +   ) in (26), noting that \u0393 (   \u03a6   h   i +   ) = \u0393 (   \u03a6   h   i   ) ,   \u03a9   \u02dc   (   \u03a6   h   i +   ) =   \u03a9   \u02dc   (   \u03a6   h   i   ) and then   U   d   int   (   \u03a6   h   i +   ) =   U   d   int   (   \u03a6   h   i   ) , and that   U   d   ext   (   \u039b   h   ( i + ) t     \u03c6   h   i +   ) =   U   d   ext   (   \u039b   h   ( i ) t     \u03c6   h   i   ) . Therefore, the discrete versions of the total linear momentum and total angular velocity  (42)    L   t , d   =   \u2211   a = 1     n   t       p   a   k    and    J   t , d   =   \u2211   a = 1     n   t     (     \u03a0   \u02dc     a   k   +   \u03c6   a   k   \u00d7   p   a   k   ) ,   are invariants of the discrete trajectories. We note that the discrete momenta need not be equal to their continuous counterparts (16) since a finite element discretization along with the corresponding quadrature rule have been introduced in order to compute their values at t 0 (see (22a) and (22b)).   Stability: In spite of the fact that nowadays there exist a deep understanding of the stability properties of numerical methods for ODE\u05f3s [29], it is widely accepted that it is not the case for methods designed to solve differential equations on Lie-groups. See e.g. [34, pp. 103] and references therein for a recent discussion about the topic. A new perspective of the stability problem is obtained by means of the so-called backward error analysis [29,19, Chapter 9]. Following that approach it is possible to show that, for a small enough time steps, the energy of the numerically computed trajectories remains exponentially close to that of a modified shadow Hamiltonian for exponentially long periods of time. Moreover, the balance equations of the modified Hamitonian are O (   h   p   ) perturbations of that obtained for the exact Hamiltonian. In this work, we follow Lew et al. [44] and we determine the time step length from the Courant condition, which provides an estimate of the stability limit for explicit integration. It is worth noting that this condition is only a necessary condition for stability i.e. it is not always sufficient to guarantee stability of the solution (an example is given in [[42, Section 4.5]). Therefore, the value of the time step is set to a fraction of the Courant limit.  This example in taken from [67] where simulations are carried out using an energy-momentum conserving scheme. The straight rod of Fig. 2 is subjected to a spatially fixed system of loads given by the force F = ( 1 / 10 ) p ( t )     e   ^     1   and moments   M   1   = p ( t )     e   ^     3   and   M   2   = 0.5 p ( t )     e   ^     2   . The time varying factor p(t) is given by   p ( t ) = {     80 t ,   t \u2208 [ 0 , 2.5 )     200 \u2212 80 t ,   t \u2208 [ 2.5 , 5.0 ]     0 ,   t > 5.0     .   The material properties are E A = G A = 10 , 000 , EI = 500 ,   A     \u03c1   0     = 1 and   I     \u03c1   0     = 10 . Zero initial conditions are assumed. The finite element mesh consists of 10 linear elements. Internal forces and moments are computed using a Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature rule with one point. The time step was set to 0.015s.  The resulting motion shows translational and tumbling components involving large rotations and large displacements. Out-of plane motion has place due to the torque about     e   ^     2   . Fig. 3 a shows that the discrete version of the total energy,   H   d   , given in (40) is nearly exactly conserved, presenting bounded oscillations around its value at t=6s. This behavior contrasts with that presented in [67] for the midpoint rule as well as for the Newmark trapezoidal rule applied to the same problem. In spite of the fact that in the present case the discrete energy is not exactly conserved, its error remains bounded for exponentially long periods of time. The exact conservation of the spatial form of the discrete version of the total angular momentum,   J   t , d   , given in (42) can be verified in Fig. 3b.  Regarding to computational aspects, for \u0394 t > 0.015  s the proposed algorithm loses stability. When compared with the implicit energy-momentum method due to Simo et al. in [67], it is possible to see that to get stable solutions, the present method requires \u0394 t  s that are 13 times smaller. However, we think that the need for smaller time steps (compared with implicit methods) is compensated by the fact that we avoid the iterative solving of large systems of nonlinear equations.  This example corresponds to the numerical simulation of the 3D dynamics of an elastic ring of radius r=5 as shown in Fig. 4 . This case has been selected due to the fact that it represents a typical structure appearing in problems of current interest n biophysics and coarse grain models in molecular dynamics (see e.g. [6,25,26,38] among others). This simulation highlights the ability of the model to reproduce the dynamics of filament-like structures involving important changes in the configuration while retaining the geometric properties of the flow.  The ring is subjected to applied moments   m   1   = m   e   2   and   m   2   = \u2212   m   1   , where m is a scalar which increases linearly from 0 to 80 in 1.5s. After that the loads are suddenly removed and the system continues vibrating freely. Since the applied moments represents a system of self-equilibrated loads, both the total linear momentum and the total angular momentum are equal to zero. Thus, they are exactly conserved during the free-fly phase of the motion.  The cross-sectional mechanical properties are E A = G A = 3 \u00d7   10   4   , EI = 7 \u00d7   10   3   ,   A     \u03c1   0     = 1 and   I     \u03c1   0     = 10 . The mesh consists of 80 linear elements and a Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature rule with one point is used to compute internal forces and internal moments. The simulation is carried out for 4.5s with \u0394 t = 0.0015  s .  The system exhibits a complex dynamics, undergoing nonlinear vibrations which involve large rotations coupled with large displacements in space. Therefore, drastic changes in the configuration have place during the motion. Fig. 5 shows a sequence of snapshots of the motion in the   e   1   \u2013   e   2   plane. The same sequence but in the   e   1   \u2013   e   3   plane is shown in Fig. 6 . Finally, the time evolution of the discrete kinetic, potential and total energies are shown in Fig. 7 from which it is possible to see the excellent long term energy behavior of the algorithm. It is worth to mention that since the method is symplectic,   H   d   cannot be exactly conserved [22]. However, by means of using backward error analysis it is possible to show that the error in the energy remains bounded for exponentially long periods of time [29, Chapter IX].   CONCLUSIONS   In this work, a new second-order accurate variational integrator for simulating the dynamics of geometrically exact rods is presented. To this end, the Reissner\u2013Simo\u05f3s theory of elastic rods in finite deformation is revisited giving special emphasis to the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian point of views of the problem. Technical issues regarding to the nonlinear nature of the configuration manifold are discussed. The discretization in space of the continuum problem is based on the finite element method. Special attention is given to the way in which rotations are interpolated to avoid singularities. Regarding to the discretization of the problem in time, a standard methodology for formulating Lie group variational integrators is used. The method is based on constructing a discrete counterpart of Hamilton\u05f3s principle to deduce discrete analogues of the Euler\u2013Lagrange equations. Additionally, the discrete Legendre transform allows to obtain a position-momentum form of the method. The discrete flow results to be symplectic and exactly conserves the invariants associated to the symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian. An explicit method is obtained if the kinetic term of the Lagrangian is computed using a Gauss\u2013Lobatto quadrature rule. Numerical examples allow to verify the excellent performance of the developed method. In particular, the exact conservation of momenta associated to symmetries of the discrete Lagrangian and a remarkably good long term energy behavior are evidenced. Future work should consider including self-contact between different parts of the rod along with parallel asynchronous integration.

First, we note that the spatial form of the inertia tensor is given by  (43)    i   \u03c1   =   \u222b   A     \u03c1   0    Tr [ z \u2297 z ]  dA  I \u2212   \u222b   A     \u03c1   0   z \u2297 z  dA =   z   \u03c1   I \u2212   J   \u03c1   ,   where   J   \u03c1   is a characteristic cross sectional tensor. The corresponding material form is   I   \u03c1   =   \u039b   t     i   \u03c1   \u039b =   e   \u03c1   I \u2212   E   \u03c1   . Moreover, for all v \u2208   R   3   , it is possible to show that  (44)  skew [   i   \u03c1   v ] =   J   \u03c1     v   \u02dc   \u2212     v   \u02dc     t     J   \u03c1   .   where   v   \u02dc   = skew [ v ] with skew [ \u2022 ] :   R   3   \u2192 SO ( 3 ) .  \u2022  Linearization of  K : The linear part of the kinetic energy is computed according to  (45)  \u03b4 K =   \u222b   0   L     A   \u03c1     \u03c6   \u0307   \u00b7 \u03b4   \u03c6   \u0307    ds \u2212   1   2     \u222b   0   L   Tr [  \u03b4   V   \u02dc     E   \u03c1     V   \u02dc   +   V   \u02dc     E   \u03c1   \u03b4   V   \u02dc    ]  ds .   Taking into account that \u03b4   V   \u02dc   =   \u039b   t   \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     \u0307   \u039b , Eq.

Linearization of    U   ext   : Denoting by   \u03c6   m   \u2261   \u039b   t   \u03c6 and by   f   m   =   \u2207     \u03c6   m       w   ext   it is possible to obtain that the linear part of (9b) as  (49)  \u03b4   U   ext   =   \u222b   0   L     f   m   \u00b7 \u03b4   \u03c6   m    ds = \u2212   \u222b   0   L   (  N \u00b7 \u03b4 \u03c6 \u2212   1   2   Tr [    M   \u02dc   \u03b4   \u03b8   \u02dc    ]  )  ds .   where N = \u039b   f   m   and   M   \u02dc   = skew [ \u03c6 \u00d7 N ] . Taking into account (45), (46), (48) and (49), integrating by parts and considering the fact that the endpoints of the trajectory of the system remain fixed, it is possible to obtain  (50)  \u03b4 S =   1   2     \u222b   0   T     \u222b   0   L   Tr [  \u03b4   \u03b8   \u02dc   (    d   dt   (  skew [   i   \u03c1   v ]  ) +   n   \u02dc     \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   S   \u2212   \u03c6   \u02dc     ,   S     n   \u02dc   \u2212   m   \u02dc     ,   S   \u2212   M   \u02dc    )  ]  ds \u2212   \u222b   0   T     \u222b   0   L   \u03b4 \u03c6 \u00b7 (    A   \u03c1     \u03c6   \u00a8   \u2212 n   ,   S   \u2212 N  )  ds .      In this section we obtain the linear part of the discrete action sum.  \u2022  Linearization of    K   d   : First, we note that    \u03b4 (    \u039b   h   ( k ) t   (    \u039b   h   k + 1   \u2212   \u039b   h   k    )  ) =   \u039b   h   ( k ) t   (  \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     h   k + 1   \u2212 \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     h   k    )   \u039b   h   k + 1   ,   then, we get that the linear part of the discrete kinetic energy as  (51a)  \u03b4   K   d   =   1     ( \u0394 t )   2       \u2211   a = 1     n   d     (    \u2211   b = 1     n   d       m   ab   (   \u03c6   b   k + 1   \u2212   \u03c6   b   k   ) \u00b7 ( \u03b4   \u03c6   a   k + 1   \u2212 \u03b4   \u03c6   a   k   ) + Tr [  ( \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k + 1   \u2212 \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k   )   R   a   k    ]  ) ,   where the components of the translational mass matrix and the nodal value of the rotational inertia tensor are given by  (51b)    m   ab   =   \u2211   i = 1     N   l       w   i     N   a   (   \u03be   i   )   A   \u03c1     N   b   (   \u03be   i   ) ,      (51c)    R   a   k   =   \u2211   i = 1     N   l       w   i     N   a   (   \u03be   i   )   J   \u03c1 ( h )   k   (   \u03be   i   )   \u039b   in ( h )   ( k ) t   (   \u03be   i   ) ,   with   J   \u03c1 ( h )   k   =   \u039b   h   k     E   \u03c1     \u039b   h   ( k ) t   and   \u039b   in ( h )   k   =   \u039b   h   ( k ) t     \u039b   h   k + 1   .   Linearization of    U   d   int   : The linear part of   U   d   int   is given by  (52a)  \u03b4   U   d   int   =   \u2211   a = 1     n   d     (  \u03b4   \u03c6   a   k   \u00b7   s   a   k   \u2212   1   2   Tr [  \u03b4     \u03b8   \u02dc     a   k       h   \u02dc     a   k    ]  ) .   where the nodal vector of internal forces,   s   a   k   , and the nodal tensor of internal moments,     h   \u02dc     a   k   , are given by  (52b)    s   a   k   =   \u2211   i = 1     N   g       w   i     N   a   (   \u03be   i   )   ,   S     n   k   (   \u03be   i   ) ,      (52c)      h   \u02dc     a   k   =   \u2211   i = 1     N   g       w   i   [    N   a   (   \u03be   i   ) (      \u03c6   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   )   ,   S       n   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   ) \u2212     n   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   )     \u03c6   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   )   ,   S    ) \u2212   N   a   (   \u03be   i   )   ,   S       m   \u02dc     h   k   (   \u03be   i   )  ] .    Remark: If a full quadrature is used to compute (52b) and (52c), a numerical pathology known as shear locking may affect the simulations (see [30, pp. 323]). Several remedies have been proposed [32] to overcome that problem. The simplest treatment consists in using reduced integration. In this work, a reduced integration with a Gauss\u2013Legendre quadrature rule is used for these terms. It does not affects the order of accuracy of the FE method as is explained in [12].
