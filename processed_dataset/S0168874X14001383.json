For Physical and Geometrical analysis of 3D steel structures at high temperatures.      Definition and implementation of thermo-plastic model.      Successful analysis of structures under fire with literature comparisons.          KEYPHRASES   3D Frame FEM based on positions  Physical and geometrical non-linear analysis  Structures at high temperatures  Thermo-plasticity  Fire   It is well known that the mechanical properties of steel degenerate significantly at elevated temperatures [1]. For example, at 700\u00b0C the strength of steel is only 23% of its ambient temperature strength. At 800\u00b0C the strength reduces to 11% and, at 900\u00b0C, to 6% of its original value. Therefore, structural designers should be able to consider the high temperature effects in the analysis of structures, especially in case of steel structures in fire situation.  The simplest way to design steel structures in fire situation is based on the verification of isolated structural members. This verification follows existent standards as described in [2\u20135], among others.  However, it is well known that the structural element behavior is very dependent on its interaction with other elements, mainly in fire [5,6], and that isolated analysis may lead both to super estimated or sub estimated strengths [7]. This affirmation is corroborated by the conclusions of the Cardington full-scale fire tests [8]. Full scale tests are very expensive and complex, therefore the development of computational codes or packages to accurately describe the steel (or other material) structure behavior at high temperatures (fire situations) are of great importance.  There are some computational codes that can model structures under high temperatures. These codes (or packages) can be classified as generalists and specialists, most of them are based on the Finite Element Method. Among the generalists one may mention the ANSYS, ABAQUS and DIANA. Among the specialists one may mention SAFIR [9,10], VULCAN [11,12], ADAPTIC [13\u201315] and FEMFAN [16\u201318]. Most of existing codes when using frame elements adopts one dimensional stress strain relations together with simple frame elements based on Euler\u2013Bernoulli kinematics. In order to reduce the computational effort, some researchers have used the plastic hinge concept instead of distributed plasticity [19\u201323]. Lien et al. [24] proposed the vector form intrinsic finite element method to analyze the behavior of steel frames in fire.  In general they consider constant or linear temperature distribution over cross sections, i.e., few of them develop thermal analysis to determine the temperature profile over the cross section in order to make the thermo-mechanical coupling, as presented in this study.  In this work we are interested to apply a more recent kinematic description, the generalized vector frame element Coda [25] and Coda and Paccola [26,27] (a solid-like formulation) to model three dimensional steel frames under fire. The interesting features of this formulation are the use of three-dimensional generalized constitutive model considering associative or non-associative plasticity and the generalized vector parameterization that avoids the use of large rotation schemes.  The proposed three dimensional elastic\u2013plastic model for steel under high temperatures is achieved here transforming the one dimensional diagrams to a set of multi-linear stress\u2013strain curves at the equivalent von-Mises space. When a change of temperature occurs a new stress\u2013strain diagram necessarily takes place and the thermodynamic consistent internal force changes in order to keep the stress level on the \u201cmoving\u201d diagram. The change of the internal force is achieved here directly by the nullity of the plastic objective yielding potential. Due to the internal force change, for the same load level, the iterative solution process is started determining a new equilibrium position with a consequent plastic strain evolution.  The thermal analysis is done by means of a 2D finite element approach considering the nonlinear thermal behavior of materials associated with Neumann and Dirichlet conditions, including convection and radiation. The thermal formulation is nonlinear, i.e., considers the thermal properties as functions of temperature and is based on the works of Huang and Usmani [28] and Lewis et al. [29]. The 2D discretization of the thermal analysis is coincident with the discretization of the solid-like frame element cross section, making possible the direct transfer of the current temperature profile to the mechanical analysis. The engineering standard CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] is used to relate the material properties and temperature.  The proposed thermo-mechanical model allows the use of any cross section, open or not, and introduces the consistent warping into solution. The nonlinear procedure is solved by the Newton\u2013Raphson implicit technique.  Several examples are shown in order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed formulation in solving thermo-mechanical elastoplastic problems, particularly, 3D steel frames under high temperatures.  The purpose of this section is providing the basis of the adopted formulation for the solid-like finite element. This strategy has been proposed by Coda [25] for elastic applications and consists on describing solids by means of generalized unconstrained vectors. Differently from classical formulations, the continuous mapping is done through non-unitary vectors that do not keep the orthogonality after deformation, which implies the natural consideration of shear effects on frame elements and the possibility of distorting cross sections.  Complete three-dimensional stress\u2013strain relation is employed and, to avoid locking and improve the structure representation, warping and strain with linear variation along the transverse direction are considered. The resulting mapping represents a long solid and uses only vector variables in Euclidean space and, consequently, the values of stress, strain and position are objective measures, i.e., independent of the translations, rotations and equilibrium path.    Fig. 1 shows a two-dimensional quadrilateral solid mapped from the dimensionless space to its shape, following both 2D classical solid procedure and the proposed vector procedure.  To illustrate the generalized vector idea we make use of a linear flat membrane and then generalize it to comprise any order frame element. The adopted linear shape functions are given by Eq. (1) and (2), with dimensionless coordinates   \u03be   1   and   \u03be   2     \u2208 [ \u2212 1 , 1 ] .  (1)    \u03c6   1   (   \u03be   1   ) =  1 2  ( 1 \u2212   \u03be   1   )      (2)    \u03c6   2   (   \u03be   1   ) =  1 2  ( 1 +   \u03be   1   )      The vector mapping is described by Eq. (3) where (   X   \u2113 i   m   ) are nodal ( \u2113 ) coordinates (i) of the reference line (m) and the vectors (   H   \u2113 i   ) are given by (4).  (3)    x   i   (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ,   X   \u2113 i   m   ,   H   \u2113 i   ) =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   X   \u2113 i   m   +     H   \u2113 i     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )  2    \u03be   2    for  i = 1 , 2  and  \u2113 = 1 , 2      (4)    X   1 i   m   =     X   1 i   +   X   4 i    2  ;    X   2 i   m   =     X   2 i   +   X   3 i    2  ;    H   1 i   =     X   4 i   \u2212   X   1 i    2    and    H   2 i   =     X   3 i   \u2212   X   2 i    2       Through the analysis of Eq. (4) it is evident that the vector mapping is done with the use of non-unitary vectors (   H   \u2113 i   ) as parameters, which are non-orthogonal to the \u201creference line\u201d that connect points   P   1   m   and   P   2   m   (see Fig. 1(b)). For frame elements, we assume constant height (h 0) and change Eq. (4) to the mapping described by Eq. (5), where   V   \u2113 i   is called a generalized vector.  (5)    x   i   (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ,   X   \u2113 i   m   ,   V   \u2113 i   ) =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   X   \u2113 i   m   +     h   0    2    \u03be   2     V   i \u2113     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )  where  i = 1 , 2  and  \u2113 = 1 , 2      For simplicity, at the initial configuration the generalized vectors are adopted as unitary and orthogonal to the reference line. However, for the current configuration these vectors are unknown and are neither unitary nor orthogonal to the reference line. Finally, Eq. (6) presents the three-dimensional version of Eq. (5), whose mapping is illustrated by Fig. 2 for a two node element.  (6)    x   i   (   \u03be   1   ,   \u03be   2   ,   \u03be   3   ,   X   \u2113 i   m   ,   V   \u2113 i   ) =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   X   \u2113 i   m   +     h   0   1    2    \u03be   2     V   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +     h   0   2    2    \u03be   3     V   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   for i = 1 , 2 , 3 and \u2113 = 1 , 2 .  Eq. (6) represents the initial mapping of the analyzed frame element. To describe the current position one changes coordinates x by coordinates y and vectors   V   \u2113 i   1   and   V   \u2113 i   2   by the so called generalized vectors   g   \u2113 i   1   and   g   \u2113 i   2   . Fig. 3 illustrates a typical mapping from initial to current configuration for a curved solid-like bar element with cubic approximation (in the longitudinal direction) and flat cross section. Although this figure shows a schematic cubic element, the developed and applied element allows the choice of any approximation order.  In Fig. 3, f and A represent the Lagrangian description of the change of configuration (deformation) and its gradient, respectively. Similarly, (   f  0  ;   f  1  ) and (   A  0  ;   A  1  ) are the mappings and their gradients of initial (0) and current (1) configurations from the auxiliary dimensionless space, written as:  (7)    f   i   0   =   x   i   =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   X   \u2113 i   m   +     h   0   1    2    \u03be   2     V   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +     h   0   2    2    \u03be   3     V   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )      (8)    f   i   1   =   y   i   =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   Y   \u2113 i   m   +     h   0   1    2    \u03be   2     g   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +     h   0   2    2    \u03be   3     g   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )      In Eqs. (7) and (8) the lower index \u2113 is no longer limited to two nodes and i varies from 1 to 3.  As mentioned before, vectors   g   i   1   ,   g   i   2   and the reference line generate the bar element. However, the geometry of the cross section can be improved to consider different shapes and materials. In this sense it is necessary to replace the constants   h   0   1   and   h   0   2   by a discretization which, multiplied by the corresponding base vectors   V   i   1   and   V   i   2   , in the initial configuration, results in the desired cross section geometry. This procedure comprises a cross section deformation that depends only on the transformations   V   i   1   \u2192   g   i   1   and   V   i   2   \u2192   g   i   2   .  To do this discretization, we adopt a two-dimensional mapping with cubic isoparametric finite elements, as sketched in Fig. 4. It is important noting that this discretization is also used to solve the nonlinear thermal problem to find the temperature profile of elements for fire analysis, see Section 6.  The pair of vectors   V   i   1   and   V   i   2   in Fig. 4 represents an orthonormal basis for the initial cross section configuration, while the pair of vectors   g   i   1   and   g   i   2   is the generic base for the current cross section configuration. For this reason, Eqs. (7) and (8) are rewritten as:  (9)    f   i   0   =   x   i   =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   X   \u2113 i   m   +   \u03b1  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   V   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +   \u03b2  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   V   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )      (10)    f   i   1   =   y   i   =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   Y   \u2113 i   m   +   \u03b1  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   g   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +   \u03b2  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   g   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   in which \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 are ordinary dimensionless coordinates of triangular finite element,   \u03b1  j  and   \u03b2  j  (known values) are coordinates of the points of the auxiliary mesh of the cross section and   \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) are the triangular element shape functions.  By adopting a complete three-dimensional constitutive law and Reissner kinematics a volume locking appears. This is due to the influence of Poisson\u05f3s ratio and unbalanced approaches to normal and shear strains [25]. To correct this problem, the current configuration kinematics is enhanced by the introduction of linear strain behavior along transverse directions and the consideration of warping effects. From this reasoning Eq. (10) is rewritten as:  (11)    f   i   1   =   y   i   =   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   Y   \u2113 i   m   +   \u03b1  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   g   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) +   \u03b2  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   )   g   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) + {   [   \u03b1  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) ]  2  (   \u039b   \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ) }   g   i \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) + {   [   \u03b2  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) ]  2  (   \u039b   \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ) }   g   i \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) + [   D   \u00d7   e l     \u03c8   \u00d7   (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) ]   \u03b6   i j k   [   g   j \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ] [   g   k \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ]   \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   )   W   \u2113     in which   \u039b   \u2113   1   and   \u039b   \u2113   2   are the intensity of the transverse strain rate and   [   \u03b1  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) ]  2  and   [   \u03b2  j    \u03c8  j  (   \u03b3   1   ,   \u03b3   2   ) ]  2  are the associated enhancement modes.  The last term in Eq. (11) represents warping, where   D   \u00d7   e l   are the modal warping parameters related to the \u00d7 points of each triangular finite element (superscript el) of the cross section discretization. This modal warping is solved for a unitary rotation by a preprocessor described by [26]. The warping direction in each solid-like finite element is given by the vector product between   g   i   1   and   g   i   2   given by  (12)    n   i   (   \u03be   1   ) =   \u03b6   i j k     g   j   1   (   \u03be   1   )   g   k   2   (   \u03be   1   ) =   \u03b6   i j k   [   g   j \u2113   1     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ] [   g   k \u2113   2     \u03c6   \u2113   (   \u03be   1   ) ]   in which   \u03b6   i j k   is the well-known Levi\u2013Cevita permutation tensor.  The warping intensity   W   \u2113   is the new degree of freedom (unknown) approximated along the finite element as the other variables. Eq. (11) represents an objective vector mapping from the dimensionless space to the current configuration of the body. This mapping results in 12 degrees of freedom per node that are: three translations, six vector components, two intensity values of the strain rate in the transverse directions and the warping intensity.  It is not necessary to explicitly know  f \u2192  to achieve the deformation gradient of the total change of configuration function, but to know    f \u2192   0  given by Eq. (9) and    f \u2192   1  given as a trial by Eq. (11). From these two mappings one writes the following gradients  (13)    A   i j   0   =   \u2202   f   i   0     \u2202   \u03be   j      and    A   i j   1   =   \u2202   f   i   1     \u2202   \u03be   j       in which \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 are called   \u03be   2   and   \u03be   3   respectively. From these values the deformation gradient given by [31,32] holds as,  (14)  A =   A  1  \u22c5   (   A  0  )   \u2212 1    or    A   i j   =   A   i k   1     B   k j   0     where   B  0  =   (   A  0  )   \u2212 1   . From the deformation gradient one writes the Cauchy\u2013Green stretch and the Green strain as:  (15)  C =   A  t  \u22c5 A =   (   A  0  )   \u2212 t   \u22c5   A   1   t   \u22c5   A   1   \u22c5   (   A  0  )   \u2212 1    or    C   i j   =   B   \u03b3 i   0     A   \u03b2 \u03b3   1     A   \u03b2 \u03b1   1     B   \u03b1 j   0        (16)  E =  1 2  [ C \u2212 I ]  or    E   i j   =  1 2  [   C   i j   \u2212   \u03b4   i j   ]      In order to give a brief, but complete, description of the developed thermo-mechanical solution, this section shows the basic steps of the elastic geometrical nonlinear solution procedure. First of all it is necessary to detach that the elastic constitutive relation is dependent of temperature; however this dependence is quite simple as the temperature profile is introduced as an independent variable (related to time) to be achieved by the thermal part of the method. Moreover, we consider negligible the heat generation resulting from the mechanical dissipation for quasi-static fire analysis. For applications that this heat generation is important (as high speed impact) the reader is invited to consult the work of Carrazedo and Coda [33] and others cited therein.  In this section, the elastic Saint-Venant\u2013Kirchhoff constitutive relation is adopted to relate the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress and the Green strain for frame elements, including thermal dilatation strains. Moreover the nonlinear equilibrium equation is achieved by the principle of stationary energy. Plasticity is introduced in Section 4 and the thermo-mechanical procedure in Sections 6 and 7.  As mentioned before the specific strain energy to be adopted here is the Saint-Venant\u2013Kirchhoff one, that relates the Green strain and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress in a linear way,  (17)    u   e   =  1 2  E : \u212d : E   in which E is the Green strain tensor and \u212d is the elastic constitutive tensor. It is worth to mention that for thermo-mechanical analysis the Green strain tensor is constituted by a mechanical (m) and a thermal (th) part, that, for relative small strains, results:  (18)  E =   E   m   \u2212   E   t h        For a given temperature (\u03b8) one writes:  (19)    E   t h   =   \u03b1   G   ( \u03b8 ) ( \u03b8 \u2212   \u03b8   r e f   ) I   in which I is the identity tensor of second order and   \u03b1   G   is the thermal dilatation coefficient for Green strain, given as a function of temperature and the nominal thermal dilatation coefficient as:  (20)    \u03b1   G   ( \u03b8 ) = \u03b1 ( \u03b8 ) + \u03b1   ( \u03b8 )  2  ( \u03b8 \u2212   \u03b8   r e f   ) / 2   in which   \u03b8   ref   is a reference temperature value. It is important to note that when plastic applications take place the Green strain given in Eq. (18) is considered as the elastic part of the total train, i.e.,   E  e  .  As the Green strain has been written as a function of nodal positions, the strain energy stored in the structure is written as:  (21)    U   e   (  Y \u2192  ) =  \u222b    V   0        u   e   d   V   0      where V 0 is the initial volume of the analyzed structure [25] and  Y \u2192  is a general nodal position vector including all 12 degrees of freedom per node.  In order to write the total potential energy of the mechanical system \u03a0 (  Y \u2192  ) one sums the strain energy, the potential energy of concentrated and distributed forces, resulting:  (22)  \u03a0 (  Y \u2192  ) =  \u222b    V   0        u   e   (  Y \u2192  ) d   V   0    \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5  Y \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5    y \u2192   m  (  Y \u2192  )  d   S   0     in which  F \u2192  is the external nodal force vector and  q \u2192  is the general distributed force vector written as function of nodal values, given by:  (23)    q   i   =   \u03d5   \u2113   ( \u03be )   Q   \u2113 i        In Eq. (22),    y \u2192   m  (  Y \u2192  ) is the current position at the reference line of frame elements, written as function of nodal positions  Y \u2192  (see Eqs. (7) and (8)) and dS 0 is the infinitesimal length of the curved frame element.  In order to find the equilibrium configuration one applies the principium of stationary potential energy on Eq. (24), using as parameters the nodal positions, as:  (24)  \u03b4 \u03a0 =  \u222b    V   0        \u2202   u   e     \u2202 E   :   \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    d   V   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192   \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5   \u2202    y \u2192   m    \u2202  Y \u2192     d   S   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  = 0      The first term of the first integral of Eq. (24) is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. Therefore, in order to simplify the understanding of the physical nonlinear procedure shown in next section, one rewrites Eq. (24) as:  (25)  \u03b4 \u03a0 =  \u222b    V   0      S :   \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    d   V   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192   \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5   \u2202    y \u2192   m    \u2202  Y \u2192     d   S   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  = 0      The understanding of Eq. (25) can be further improved defining the first integral as the internal nodal force and the last integral as the equivalent nodal force of distributed forces [34], resulting:  (26)  \u03b4 \u03a0 =    F \u2192    int   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  \u2212 L \u22c5  Q \u2192  \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  = 0   in which L is the matrix that transforms the distributed forces into nodal equivalent ones. Due to the arbitrariness of \u03b4  Y \u2192  Eq. (26) results into the geometrical nonlinear equilibrium equation, as:  (27)     F \u2192    int   +    M \u2192    int   \u2212  F \u2192  \u2212 L \u22c5  Q \u2192  = 0      The Newton\u2013Raphson procedure is used here to solve the nonlinear equilibrium, which is described in Section 5, including the physical nonlinear behavior of materials.  The difference between the elastic and inelastic procedures is the way the potential energy of external forces is transferred to the deformed body and dissipated during the loading process. In this case, instead of using the elastic strain energy, one uses the Helmholtz free energy potential, that usually does not have an explicit expression; however, its variation is known [35].  Following this reasoning the total potential energy is written as:  (28)  \u03a0 (  Y \u2192  , \u03b8 ) =  \u222b    V   0      \u03a8 ( E ( \u03b8 ,  Y \u2192  ) , \u212d ( \u03b8 ) , \u210c ( \u03b8 ) , a ) d   V   0    \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5  Y \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5    y \u2192   m  (  Y \u2192  )  d   S   0     where \u03a8 is the free energy potential, written as function of the Green strain tensor E ( \u03b8 ,  Y \u2192  ) , the elastic constitutive tensor \u212d ( \u03b8 ) , the hardening parameter tensor \u210c ( \u03b8 ) and the thermodynamic parameter a . It is important to note that this free energy potential is similar to the isothermal one as we decide that the heat generated by the mechanical dissipation is negligible in the analyzed problem. Therefore, the dependence of temperature is omitted in the passages where it does not have importance and opportunely resumed.  The variation of the total potential energy is null at the equilibrium position, i.e.:  (29)  \u03b4 \u03a0 =  \u222b    V   0        \u2202 \u03a8   \u2202 E   :   \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    d   V   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192   \u2212  F \u2192  \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5   \u2202    y \u2192   m    \u2202  Y \u2192     d   S   0   \u22c5 \u03b4  Y \u2192  = 0   in which parameter a is not present due to its intrinsic relation with E and S to be shown in item 4.2.  Even for inelastic problems, the energy conjugate of the free energy potential regarding Green strain is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. In this way, Eq. (29) can be written exactly as Eq. (25). However, with a physical nonlinear meaning, i.e., while the passage from Eqs. (24) and (25) is done by a simple differentiation of the quadratic potential shown by Eq. (17), now it is necessary the definition of inelastic (plastic for instance) constitutive relations to describe the material behavior and its evolution rule. Moreover, this elastoplastic relation should be adapted to comprise imposed temperature changes.  In this section, the constitutive elastoplastic relation is described. One may classify the developed constitutive relation as non-associative with an unknown plastic potential for which its normal direction (plastic flow) is defined by the trial stress direction. The theoretical basis of this constitutive relation is given by the study of volume change in plastic phase given by Botta et al. [36]. Moreover, we assume a multi-linear stress strain diagram (in the von-Mises equivalent space) without a limit for the number of elastoplastic patches, which enables an accurate reproduction of any stress strain relation.  Although, the developed displacements are high, the strain level present in our applications is relatively small. Therefore, the Green strain approximates the linear strain and the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress can be used in place of the Cauchy stress. Following this reasoning we adopt the additive strain decomposition, as:  (30)  E =   E  e  +   E  p    in which E   e and E   p are, respectively, the elastic and plastic parts of E . Moreover E   e comprise the thermal strain as described by Eq. (19). Therefore, the free energy potential can be written as:  (31)  \u03a8 ( E \u2212   E  p  , \u212d , \u210c , a ) =  1 2    E  e  : \u212d :   E  e  +  1 2  a . H . a   where \u212d is the elastic constitutive tensor and \u210c (in a general representation ) is a second order tensor that includes the hardening parameters. The temperature dependence is omitted as it is considered an independent variable.  The second Piola\u2013Kirchhoff stress and the thermodynamic force \u03c7 are written as:  (32)  S =   \u2202 \u03a8   \u2202 E   = \u212d :   E  e  = \u212d : ( E \u2212   E  p  )      (33)  \u03c7 = \u2212   \u2202 \u03a8   \u2202 a   = \u2212 \u210c . a      At this point it is important to mention that \u03c7 as a function of \u210c is dependent of temperature and this dependence is solved in Section 7. As mentioned after Eq. (29), in order to eliminate a from equilibrium equation it is necessary to relate E    p  and a .  In classical formulations this is done introducing a plastic potential F ( S , \u03c7 )  [37] from which one writes:  (34)     E \u0307   p  =  \u03bb \u0307    \u2202 F   \u2202 S        (35)   a \u0307  =  \u03bb \u0307    \u2202 F   \u2202 \u03c7     where \u03bb is the plastic multiplier. From Eqs. (34) and (35)     E \u0307   p  and  a \u0307  are related when one eliminates the plastic multiplier that satisfies the Khun\u2013Tucker conditions:  (36)   \u03bb \u0307  \u2265 0 , f \u2264 0 ,  \u03bb \u0307   f = 0   where f ( S , \u03c7 ) is the yielding (failure) surface. Particularly, in this work we adopt the Von-Mises surface, i.e.,  (37)  f =     J   2     \u2212 \u03c7 \u2212   S   p     in which the equivalent von-Mises stress  (38)   \u03c3 \u00af  =   J   2   = 1 / 2 [  S \u00af  :    S \u00af   t  ]   is the second invariant of the deviatory stress  S \u00af  , and  (39)    S   p   =   \u03c3   p   /  3  =   f   p   /  3    is the initial size of the Von-Mises surface, in which   \u03c3   p   is the yielding uniaxial stress. In expression (37) \u03c7 is assumed to be scalar resulting in scalar values for \u03b1 and \u210c in Eqs. (33) and (35). Moreover, isotropic hardening is adopted.  Although the equivalent strain is not used at this stage of the solution, see Section 7, it is worth mentioning that it is calculated following a similar way as the equivalent stress, i.e.,  (40)   \u03b5 \u00af  = 1 / 2 [  E \u00af  :    E \u00af   t  ]      Although not mentioned   \u03c3   p   and S  p depends on temperature. Therefore the yielding surface size and evolution depend upon temperature, this dependence will be solved in Section 7.  Instead of introducing a plastic potential which gradient imposes the plastic flow direction, see Eq. (34), we prefer to define the plastic flow from the current stress state (trial in practical situations) as indicated by [36], that is:  (41)    \u2202 F   \u2202 S   = \u03b7 =    D \u00af   p  : S  \u21d2     E \u0307   p  =  \u03bb \u0307  \u03b7   and  (42)    \u2202 F   \u2202 \u03c7   = \u2212 1  \u21d2   \u03bb \u0307  = \u2212  \u03b1 \u0307    where  (43)     D \u00af   p  =  G      J   2         (    \u212d \u00af   p  )   \u2212 1             \u212d \u00af   p  is a fourth order constitutive tensor similar to a typical elastic constitutive tensor and    D \u00af   p  is related with its inverse. In order to write \u03b7 in a concisely form one appeals to some basic elastic operations, that is:  (44)  S = \u212d : E = 2 G  E \u00af  + k  t r ( E ) I      (45)  E = D : S =   S \u00af   2 G   +   t r ( S )   9 k   I   where k is the bulk modulus and G is the shear modulus. Therefore,  (46)  \u03b7 =    D \u00af   p  : S =  G      J   2        (    S \u00af   2 G   +   t r ( S )   9   k  p    I  )       In expression (46)    k  p  = E / [ 3 ( 1 \u2212 2   \u03bd  p  ) ] means that    \u212d \u00af   p  is similar to C less the bulk modulus that depends on the plastic Poisson. Following this strategy, when   \u03bd  p  \u2245 0.5 isochoric plasticity takes place and when \u03bd =   \u03bd  p  the plastic flow occurs in the same direction of elastic flow. In this work we adopt    \u212d \u00af   p  = \u212d , defined by the second derivative of expression (17) regarding strain. This choice releases any possible locking due to the adopted Reissner kinematic.  Instead of following classical procedure, for which the previous equations are solved in an infinitesimal way, from basic definitions and considering the hardening parameter H constant by parts (multi-linear plasticity) we write an implicit (numerical) closed solution for the constitutive model variables. We assume a typical interval [   t   n   ,   t   n + 1   ] and adopt an elastic trial, written as:       E  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2192 Total  stress  elastic  trial      E  ( n + 1 )   p    t  =   E   n   p   \u2192 Accumulated  plastic  strain ( assumed  as  trial )      \u03bb  ( n + 1 )     t  =   \u03bb   n   = \u2212   a   n   \u2192 Internal  variable  trial      \u03c7  ( n + 1 )     t  =   \u03c7   n   \u2192 Thermodynamic  internal  force  trial         Using these variables we calculate the stress level considering \u0394   E  p  as the main unknown, as follows:  (47)    S   ( n + 1 )   = \u212d : (  E  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212  E  n   p    t  \u2212 \u0394   E  p  ) =  S  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212 \u212d : \u0394   E  p    where the trial stress  S     t  is known. Using this value we calculate the trial yielding potential:  (48)   f  ( n + 1 )     t  =    J 2    t    \u2212  \u03c7     t  \u2212   S   p        If  f  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2264 0 the step is elastic and the trial variables are the correct ones. However, if  f  ( n + 1 )     t  > 0 then the step is elastoplastic and \u0394   E  p  must be fount to guaranty the nullity of   f   ( n + 1 )   . This situation is solved here in a closed form, because \u210c is considered constant by pats. Therefore, from Eq. (46) one writes:  (49)  \u03b7 =   D  p  :  S  ( n + 1 )     t  =  G      J   2        (      S \u00af   ( n + 1 )     t    2 G   +   t r (  S  ( n + 1 )     t  )   9   k  p    I  )       (50)  \u0394   E  p  = \u0394 \u03bb \u03b7      (51)    E   ( n + 1 )   p   =  E  ( n + 1 )   p    t  + \u0394   E  p       (52)    \u03c7   ( n + 1 )   =  \u03c7  ( n + 1 )     t  + \u210c \u0394 \u03bb      Introducing (50) and (52) into Eq. (47) and operating \u212d : \u0394   E  P  one writes:  (53)  S =  S  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212 \u0394 \u03bb \u2032  [    S \u00af   ( n + 1 )     t  +  k  3   k  P    t r (  S  ( n + 1 )     t  ) I  ]    with  (54)  \u0394 \u03bb \u2032 = \u0394 \u03bb  G     J  2 ( n + 1 )     t           Splitting  S  ( n + 1 )     t  in its deviatory and hydrostatic parts, Eq. (53) is rewritten as:  (55)  S =   S \u00af   ( n + 1 )     t  ( 1 \u2212 \u0394 \u03bb \u2032 ) +   t r (  S  ( n + 1 )     t  )  3   [  1 \u2212  k    k  P    \u0394 \u03bb \u2032  ]  I      Calculating   f   ( n + 1 )   and imposing its nullity, results:  (56)    f   ( n + 1 )   = ( 1 \u2212 \u0394 \u03bb \u2032 )    J  2 ( n + 1 )     t    \u2212  \u03c7  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212 \u210c \u0394 \u03bb \u2212   S   p   = 0      From Eqs. (56) and (54) one finds:  (57)  \u2212 ( G + \u210c ) \u0394 \u03bb +    J  2 ( n + 1 )     t    \u2212  \u03c7  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212   S   p   = 0   or  (58)  \u0394 \u03bb =    f  ( n + 1 )     t    ( G + \u210c )        Finally, the searched plastic strain is found using (48), (50) and (58), that is,  (59)  \u0394   E  P  =    f  ( n + 1 )     t    ( G + \u210c )    (      S \u00af   ( n + 1 )     t    2    J  2 ( n + 1 )     t      +   t r (  S     t  )   9   k  P     J  2 ( n + 1 )     t       )       To find the Hessian matrix for the solution technique one uses the differential process. The equivalent expressions to (58) and (59) are:  (60)  d \u03bb =    S \u00af  : \u212d : d E    S \u00af  : \u212d : \u03b7 + 2     J   2     \u210c     and  (61)  d   E  p  =  (     S \u00af  : \u212d : d E    S \u00af  : \u212d : \u03b7 + 2     J   2     \u210c    )  \u03b7      Finally, the tangent constitutive tensor is:  (62)    \u212d   e p   =   \u2202 S   \u2202 E   =     \u2202  2  \u03a8   \u2202 E \u2202 E   = \u212d \u2212  (    \u212d : \u03b7 \u2297  S \u00af  : \u212d    S \u00af  : \u212d : \u03b7 + 2     J   2     \u210c    )  = \u212d \u2212   \u212d  p       This tensor is not symmetric, as the plastic potential (not explicitly written) is not the same as the yielding (failure) surface. In order to avoid asymmetry, in the numerical procedure, we use only the diagonal of   \u212d  p  to assemble the Hessian. This quasi-tangent matrix accelerates the convergence of the solution process, see Section 5.  Knowing the elastoplastic constitutive model, to start the solution process one rewrites the equilibrium Eq. (29) removing the arbitrary variation of positions ( \u03b4  Y \u2192  ), as:  (63)   g \u2192  (  Y \u2192  ) =  \u222b    V   0        \u2202 \u03a8   \u2202 E   :   \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    d   V   0    \u2212  F \u2192  \u2212  \u222b    S   0       q \u2192  \u22c5   \u2202    y \u2192   m    \u2202  Y \u2192     d   S   0   =  0 \u2192    in which \u2202 \u03a8 / \u2202 E is the second Piola\u2013Kirchhoff stress, Eq. (32).  Remembering that the process is nonlinear, Eq. (63) is expanded in Taylor series from a trial position    Y \u2192    0   , i.e.:  (64)   g \u2192  (  Y \u2192  ) \u2245  g \u2192  (    Y \u2192    0   ) +      \u2202  g \u2192    \u2202  Y \u2192     |      Y \u2192    0     \u0394  Y \u2192  =  0 \u2192       Solving the linear system of Eq. (64) one finds the position correction, applied as  Y \u2192  =  Y \u2192  + \u0394  Y \u2192  until | \u0394  Y \u2192  | / |  X \u2192  | < t o l , in which tol is the tolerance in positions and  X \u2192  is the initial nodal positions of the body. As the applied forces are conservative the derivative of  g \u2192  regarding positions results:  (65)    \u2202  g \u2192    \u2202  Y \u2192    =  (    \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    :     \u2202  2  \u03a8   \u2202 E \u2202 E   :   \u2202 E   \u2202  Y \u2192    + S :     \u2202  2  E   \u2202  Y \u2192  \u2202  Y \u2192     )    in which   \u2202  2  \u03a8 / \u2202 E \u2202 E is given by Eq. (62).  The derivatives of the Green strain regarding positions can be seen elsewhere [25\u201327].  As mentioned in introduction the main objective of this study is the mechanical behavior of steel structures under high temperatures (fire). Therefore, this section briefly describes the transient thermal analysis used to generate the temperature profiles at the cross sections of structural members. Most of equations, developments and implementations are based on Huang and Usmani [28] and Lewis et al. [29]. In the next section, knowing the temperature profile, the elastoplastic constitutive relation is adapted to comprise temperature changes.  In this study, thermal analyses are based on the classical heat diffusion (or conduction) equation in solids,  (66)  \u03c1 c   d \u03b8   d t   \u2212 \u03bb   \u2207  2  \u03b8 \u2212 q = 0      In which c is the specific heat, \u03c1 is the density, \u03bb is the thermal conductivity, q is the amount heat generated in the material per unit volume, \u03b8 is temperature (Kelvin) and t is time.  Considering the discretization of a domain (in this case a cross section at the reference configuration) by finite elements (Fig. 4(a)) and applying the method of weighted residuals with consideration of the appropriate boundary conditions, one achieves Eq. (67) which describes, in matrix form, the balance of heat flow inside the considered domain at a given instant.  (67)  [ C ]  {    \u2202 \u03b8   \u2202 t    }  + [ K ] { \u03b8 } = { F }      In Eq. (67) [C] is the heat capacity matrix, [K] is the thermal stiffness matrix and {F} is the vector of nodal heat flux. The matrices [C], [K] and vector {F} are known while {\u03b8} is the vector of unknown parameters (temperature). The nonlinear characteristic of Eq. (67) is the dependence on temperature of matrices [C] and [K] which becomes evident in the solution process.  To obtain the numerical solution of Eq. (67) it is necessary to discretize the differential operator involving the transient term \u2202 \u03b8 / \u2202 t . Here it is done using a numerical approximation based on the Finite Difference Method, with a strategy similar to that presented in [28,29].    Fig. 5 illustrates a typical temperature variation during a time interval [t  n ;t  n+1]. Using Taylor series, it is possible to describe the variation of temperature at time n + \u03d5 as  (68)    \u03b8   n + \u03d5   =   \u03b8   n   + \u03d5 \u0394 t   \u2202   \u03b8   n + \u03d5     \u2202 t   + \u03c6   \u0394   t  2   2      \u2202  2    \u03b8   n + \u03d5     \u2202   t  2    + .. .      For a given time interval \u0394 t and observing the scheme of Fig. 5 one writes  (69)    \u2202   \u03b8   n + \u03d5     \u2202 t   \u2248     \u03b8   n + 1   \u2212   \u03b8   n     \u0394 t        The temperature at the instant   t   n + \u03d5   can be written as  (70)    \u03b8   n + \u03d5   = \u03d5   \u03b8   n + 1   + ( 1 \u2212 \u03d5 )   \u03b8   n        Writing Eq. (67) for instant   t   n + \u03d5   ,  (71)    [ C ]   n + \u03d5     {    \u2202 \u03b8   \u2202 t    }   n + \u03d5   +   [ K ]   n + \u03d5     { \u03b8 }   n + \u03d5   =   { F }   n + \u03d5     and using approximations (69) and (70) results  (72)   (      [ C ]   n + \u03d5     \u0394 t   + \u03d5   [ K ]   n + \u03d5    )    { \u03b8 }   n + 1   =  (      [ C ]   n + \u03d5     \u0394 t   + ( \u03d5 \u2212 1 )   [ K ]   n + \u03d5    )    { \u03b8 }   n   +   { F }   n + \u03d5        The system of Eq. (72) is compacted according to Eq. (73) where the terms   [  K \u02dc  ]   n + \u03d5   and   {  F \u02dc  }   n + \u03d5   are given by Eqs. (74) and (75), respectively.  (73)    [  K \u02dc  ]   n + \u03d5     { \u03b8 }   n + 1   =   {  F \u02dc  }   n + \u03d5        (74)    [  K \u02dc  ]   n + \u03d5   =     [ C ]   n + \u03d5     \u0394 t   + \u03c6   [ K ]   n + \u03d5        (75)    {  F \u02dc  }   n + \u03d5   =  (      [ C ]   n + \u03d5     \u0394 t   + ( \u03d5 \u2212 1 )   [ K ]   n + \u03d5    )    { \u03b8 }   n   +   { F }   n + \u03d5        In order to solve Eq. (73) one needs to choose the value of \u03d5, which defines the integration scheme. According Cook et al. [38], for values of \u03d5 \u2265 0.5 the solution of linear or nonlinear problems are unconditionally stable and when it is assumed to be 2/3 the Galerkin scheme is followed.  At elevated temperatures one must consider the thermal properties of materials as a function of temperature, such as specific heat, density and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the thermal flow at boundary of structural members is highly dependent of the typical actions of fire. This aspect gives to the thermal problem a nonlinear characteristic, detached in the temperature dependence of   [ K ]   n + \u03d5   ,   [ C ]   n + \u03d5   and   { F }   n + \u03d5   , in Eq. (72). It is obvious that depending on temperature, these values will also depend on time. To solve this nonlinear system of equation the Newton\u2013Raphson procedure is employed as follows.  Eq. (73) is rewritten considering a trial temperature, as  (76)    { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i   =   {  F \u02dc  }   n + \u03d5   i   \u2212   [  K \u02dc  ]   n + \u03d5   i     { \u03b8 }   n + 1   i ( t r i a l )     in which   { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i   is the residuum of the solution for the trial temperature. Eq. (76) is expanded in Taylor series up to the first order imposing the nullity of the final residuum, i.e.,  (77)    { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i + 1   =   { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i   + \u2207   { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i     { \u0394 \u03b8 }   n + 1   i   \u2245 0      Solving the linear system of Eq. (77) a correction for temperature is achieved,  (78)    { \u0394 \u03b8 }   n + 1   i   = \u2212   ( \u2207   { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i   )   \u2212 1     { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i     improving the trial temperature by  (79)    { \u03b8 }   n + 1   i + 1 ( t r i a l )   =   { \u03b8 }   n + 1   i ( t r i a l )   +   { \u0394 \u03b8 }   n + 1   i        For a time step this procedure is repeated until   { \u03c8 }   n + 1   i   or   { \u0394 \u03b8 }   n + 1   i   can be considered negligible.   Section 4 describes the elastoplastic constitutive relation, Section 5 indicates how the nonlinear mechanical problem is solved and Section 6 briefly describes how the temperature profile is achieved in a bar element cross section. In this item, considering known the temperature profile, the constitutive relation is extended to include the temperature influence.  As mentioned before, when temperature changes the mechanical properties of material change, as elastic modulus, hardening parameter and strength levels. Taking as reference the Eurocode CEN EN1993-1-2:2005 [30], the steel reduction factors for yielding strength f  y , elastic limit f  p and elastic modulus E as a function of temperature can be described by Fig. 6.  Following [30] a general diagram of uniaxial stress\u2013strain relation for carbon steel can be seen in Fig. 7.  Particularly, as an example, for steel with yielding limit of 250MPa and strain up to 2% some stress\u2013strain relations achieved using [30] can be seen in Fig. 8.  As mentioned before, we assume a multi-linear stress strain diagram without a limit for the number of elastoplastic patches, which enables an accurate reproduction of any stress strain relation. The most important point of the diagram that should be precisely indicated is ( \u03b5 ,   f   p   ) that defines the beginning of plastic evolution, as it should be in accordance with the elastic modulus definition.  First of all, the uniaxial diagrams of Figs. 7 and 8 are transformed to equivalent stress\u2013strain relations (based on Eqs. (39) and (40)) simply dividing it by  3  . Therefore, at an imposed load level and temperature the structure is at equilibrium and one knows, from Eqs. (39), (40), (51) and (52), the equivalent stress (  \u03c3 \u00af  ( \u03b8 ) ), the equivalent strain (  \u03b5 \u00af  ( \u03b8 ) ), the developed equivalent plastic strain ( \u03bb ( \u03b8 ) ) and the thermodynamic internal force ( \u03c7 ( \u03b8 ) ). The last two values store the history of plastic evolution along the loading process, including previous temperature changes. The equivalent strain already contains the thermal dilatation related to temperature changes.  If, for this load level, a temperature change occurs our task is to find the new values  \u03c3 \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) ,  \u03b5 \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) , \u03bb ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) and \u03c7 ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) . As it is a nonlinear process, one should remember that before and after the change of temperature these values should respect the restriction:  (80)  f ( \u03b8 ) =  \u03c3 \u00af  ( \u03b8 ) \u2212 \u03c7 ( \u03b8 ) \u2212   S   p   ( \u03b8 ) \u2264 0   and  (81)  f ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) =  \u03c3 \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2212 \u03c7 ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2212   S   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2264 0   with  (82)   \u03bb \u0307  \u2265 0  and   \u03bb \u0307  f = 0      The procedure to be followed is the same as described in Section 4.2.2. (variable evolution) with the difference that, before starting the calculation of \u0394 \u03bb the stress\u2013strain curve is changed and some starting (trial) variables should be calculated.  The new value   S   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) =   f   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) /  3  is known from the changing stress\u2013strain diagram, see previous item.  The internal force produced by the history of hardening is no longer valid and to achieve a new plausible trial value, for this variable, the following auxiliary equation is proposed:  (83)    \u03c3 \u00af  \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2212  \u03c7     t  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2212   S   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) = 0   in which   \u03c3 \u00af  \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) is the equivalent stress level achieved using the equivalent stress\u2013strain diagram ( Fig. 9) for ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) considering  \u03b5 \u00af  ( \u03b8 ) , resulting:  (84)   \u03c7     t  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) =   \u03c3 \u00af  \u00af  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u2212   S   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 )      Now, using Eqs. (18) and (40), the total equivalent strain is changed to comprise the variation of thermal strain. Using Eq. (47) and the updated strain (elastic part), the trial stress value is changed only in its elastic part, as  (85)   S  ( n + 1 )     t  = \u212d : (  E  ( n + 1 )     t  \u2212  E  n   p    t  )   resulting in the trial equivalent stress   \u03c3 \u00af      t  ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) , using (38).  Finally the new evolution equation, the same as Eq. (55), is written as  (86)    f   ( n + 1 )   = ( 1 \u2212 \u0394 \u03bb \u2032 )   \u03c3 \u00af      t    ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 )   ( n + 1 )   \u2212  \u03c7     t    ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 )   ( n + 1 )   \u2212 \u210c ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) \u0394 \u03bb \u2212   S   p   ( \u03b8 + \u0394 \u03b8 ) = 0   and solved, as did previously, finding \u0394\u03bb and all new variables to be updated in the Newton\u2013Raphson iterative process of the mechanical equilibrium. It is worth noting that the hardening parameter in Eq. (86) is also known directly from the new equivalent stress\u2013strain diagram. Moreover, after solving (86) a plastic strain develops resulting in a mechanical accommodation due to the reduction of the thermodynamic internal force promoted by the change in stress\u2013strain diagram. It is important to note that for cooling the procedure is the same, however in most situations, the internal force grows and the step is elastic. Fig. 9 shows a representation of the steps described in this item.  In this section some high temperature examples are used to show the possibilities of the formulation, as well as to demonstrate its good results when compared with other computational codes and references. For validation examples at room temperature comprising inelastic analyses of steel frames the reader is invited to consult [39]. For applications that heat generation is important (as high speed impact) the reader is invited to consult [33].  Our code will be called SYSAF all along this section. Only the last two examples employ the nonlinear thermal solver, as there is a lack of references to perform comparisons.  A simply supported beam, Fig. 10, is analyzed under actions of heating and cooling using the CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] temperature dependence of the constitutive model and relative thermal elongation for steel at high temperatures. The achieved results are compared with the ones presented by Yu et al. [12] using solid elements, via ABAQUS and VULCAN softwares.  This beam is heated from 20\u00b0C to 670\u00b0C and then cooled back to 20\u00b0C. The elastic modulus is E = 210  GPa , the reference yielding stress   f   y   = 355  MPa and the adopted Poisson is \u03bd = 0.0 .  Yu et al. [12] solved this problem using both solid and frame elements. They adopted 1920 hexahedral solid finite elements (16 for a cross section) and three quadratic beam finite elements.  In our work we adopt a temperature step of 2.5\u00b0C, four cubic finite elements and eighth triangular cubic \u201celements\u201d for thermal considerations and elastoplastic treatment of cross sections. Moreover, we solved the same example using the ANSYS package using ten quadratic BEAM189 elements.  Results of midspan displacements versus temperature are compared in Fig. 11. As one can see, results achieved by [12] are in reasonable accordance to ABAQUS, however our results compare very well with ANSYS.  Next examples compare SYSAF with experimental results and other computational codes confirming the good behavior of our formulation to model steel frame structures under fire.    Fig. 12 shows a typical beam tested by Rubert and Schaumann [40] with the objective of verifying the behavior of structures subjected simultaneously to mechanical and thermal actions.  Izzuddin et al. [14] present numerical results using their computational code (ADAPTIC) to model a Rubert and Schaumann [40] beam. We did the same using our code (SYSAF). The cross section of the beam is of type IPE 80 and is discretized as depicted in Fig. 12(b). The beam is discretized by four cubic finite elements.  Four load levels, proportional to the collapse load at 20\u00b0C, are imposed to the beam. The proportionality constants are 0.2, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.85. At 20\u00b0C the elastic modulus is E = 210  GPa , the reference yielding stress is   f   y   = 399  MPa and the adopted Poisson is \u03bd = 0.0 . The thermal dilatation coefficient is constant and equal to 14\u00d710\u22126 \u00b0C\u22121. The elastic modulus (   k   E , \u03b8   ), the proportionality limit (   k   p , \u03b8   ) and yielding limit (   k   y , \u03b8   ) reduction factors are given by Table 1 following [40,14]. The stress\u2013strain diagrams are built following CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30].  The test displacement at the midspan of the beam by [40], regarding temperature and each load level, are depicted in Fig. 13 together with the results achieved by SYSAF and ADAPTIC [14].  As one may note the results achieved by the developed code compare well with the ones achieved by ADAPTIC and reproduce the experimental behavior of the beam.  Three series of scaled steel frames, called EHR, EGR and ZSR ( Fig. 14), tested by and Rubert and Schaumann [40] are considered. All cross sections are of the type IPE 80. Frame series EHR and EGR are uniformly heated while only the left cell of frame ZSR is heated.  These cases were numerically analyzed by [14,16,23,24,40] among others. In order to make comparisons our code (SYSAF) is compared with experimental values given by Rubert and Schaumann [40] and the numerical results presented by Izzuddin et al. [14] using their package ADAPTIC.  In Table 2 one finds all required physical parameters. It should be noted that f  y,0 means the yielding limit at 20\u00b0C.  At 20\u00b0C the elastic modulus is E = 210  GPa , the adopted Poisson is \u03bd = 0.0 and the thermal dilatation coefficient is constant and equal to 14\u00d710\u22126 \u00b0C\u22121. The elastic modulus (   k   E , \u03b8   ), the proportionality limit (   k   p , \u03b8   ) and yielding limit (   k   y , \u03b8   ) reduction factors are given by Table 1 and the stress\u2013strain diagrams are built following CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30].  We employed SYSAF with four cubic frame elements and the cross section discretization presented in Fig. 12(b). The experimental and numerical collapse temperatures are presented in Table 3.  Both SYSAF and ADAPTIC achieved collapse temperatures lower than the experimental ones. Moreover relative differences are less than 6%. The experimental displacements [40], regarding temperature and load level, are depicted in   Figs. 15\u201317 together with the results achieved by SYSAF and ADAPTIC [14].  As it can be seen our formulation gives good results for these cases when compared to experimental and numerical results achieved by [14] using DAPTIC.  The three-dimensional frame, Fig. 18, was firstly analyzed by Souza J\u00fanior and Creus [23] using the package SAFIR. All sections are of the type H 150\u00d7150\u00d77\u00d710 and the material is steel with   f   y   = 325  MPa . The load F = 250  kN is applied before heating. The constitutive relation and relative thermal elongation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] recommendations.  The fire is simulated by a uniform heating of all first floor frame elements. Each member is discretized by four cubic frame elements. The cross section discretization follows the same pattern described in Fig. 12(b).  Displacements at points H1 and H2 (Fig. 18) achieved by our formulation (SYSAF), ANSYS (BEAM189) and SAFIR [23] are compared in Fig. 19.  As it can be seen all codes give similar results (less than 2.5% of difference for collapse temperature), confirming that our formulation is adequate to solve steel structures under high temperatures and uniform heating conditions. Moreover, our formulation applies three-dimensional constitutive relation, which indicates a more general approach for frame elements. Next examples show cases for which the cross section thermal analyses are required.  This example was presented by Landesmann et al. [22] and is the simulation of a pin-ended IPE-360 beam-column exposed to a standard time\u2013temperature curve ISO 834 [41].  The two analyzed models are depicted in Fig. 20, including the geometry and both mechanical and thermal loads. The load combination (N and M) is fraction of the strength capacity of the column at 20\u00b0C, i.e., N y20 (compression) and M p20 (bending).  In the first situation the beam-column is heated at all faces (Fig. 20(a)) while in the second situation only three faces of the column are heated (Fig. 20(b)). Following [22] the last situation represents a facade column where one of the flanges is partially protected from fire.  The adopted cross section discretization and the achieved temperature profile at 200s, 500s and 800s of analysis using SYSAF are described, respectively, in   Figs. 21\u201323.  At 20\u00b0C the material presents E = 205  GPa and   f   y   = 250  MPa . The stress\u2013strain diagram and relative thermal elongation elongation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] recomendations.  The achieved results by Landesmann et al. [22] using SAFIR and SAAFE are compared with our results at Fig. 24. It is important to note that SAAFE adopts concentrated plasticity, while SAFIR and SYSAF adopt distributed plasticity. One can see in Fig. 24 that our results are in good conformity with the ones presented by [22] using SAFIR, i.e., distributed plasticity.  The Vogel\u05f3s portal frame [42] is solved here for a fire situation proposed by Landesmann et al. [22]. The original loading combination was applied at different load ratios \u03c8. The structure is exposed to heating according the ISO 834 curve [41]. All the members were assumed to be fire protected at the external faces ( Fig. 25).  We adopted four cubic finite elements for each structural member. The thermal analysis is carried out using the discretizations depicted in Fig. 26(a) and (b) for cross sections HEB 300 and HEA 340. Fig. 26 also shows the temperature fields at 750s.  The relative thermal elongation and stress\u2013strain relation follow CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30]. Fig. 27 compares our results (SYSAF) with the ones presented by Landesmann et al. [22] (SAFIR) for load ratios \u03c8 equal to 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8.  As one can see the results are in good agreement between formulations which implies that both formulations may be used to model structures under high temperatures. Our results present a more stiff behavior when compared to the one presented by Landesmann et al. [22] for low load factors. However, it is not possible to conclude that this difference is associated with difference in formulations, as the problem is very dependent on the large amount of variables and boundary conditions prescribed. However, we believe that using a 3D formulation, as ours, more realistic results can be achieved in more general analysis.  In order to explore the possibilities of the developed formulation we solve a typical case that demand thermal analysis for determining the temperature field of the steel profile during heating, i.e., temperature field cannot be determined by means of simplified equations. Moreover, a convergence analysis is performed regarding mechanical and thermal behavior of the solution indicating the fast convergence of the integration procedure.  A steel beam with cross section H 200\u00d7100\u00d75.5\u00d78 embedded in a concrete slab ( Fig. 28) submitted to fire is analyzed. Only the bottom surfaces of the beam and slab are exposed to effects of ambient heating according the ISO 834 standard fire curve [41]. Heat exchange to an ambient at 20\u00b0C is also considered at the top of slab. The resultant emissivity for steel and concrete is assumed 0,7. The heat transfer convection coefficient is assumed 25    W / m  2    C     o  at the surfaces exposed to fire and 4    W / m  2    C     o  at the top of slab. The concrete is considered non-structural, acting as a heat sink material. The thermal properties of steel and concrete are in accordance with CEN EN 1994-1-2:2005 [43].  At 20\u00b0C a simplified stress\u2013strain diagram is adopted with elastic modulus E = 210  GPa , reference yielding stress   f   y   = 355  MPa and Poisson ratio \u03bd = 0.0 . Perfect elastoplasticity is adopted until a strain of 0.15, when a softening is imposed reducing stress to zero at a strain of 0.2.  Only two cubic elements are able to capture the exact elastic bending moment distribution of the proposed static scheme. However, for the elastoplastic analysis the integration points, responsible to capture residual stresses, should be near to the center of the beam. Therefore, we used four finite elements, two with 195cm length near the ends and two with 5cm near the center to model the structure. No sensible changes in results are achieved when varying the central elements lengths.  The very good convergence of the plastic behavior can be seen in Fig. 29 for which two cross section discretizations are tested, one very poor with 18 triangular divisions, see Fig. 30a, and other with 62 triangular divisions, see Fig. 30b. As one can see, the very poor discretization presents practically the same results as the regular one, characterizing convergence. Moreover, the maximum difference in force among each other is less than 0.27%. Thirty seven displacement steps of 1mm each are imposed at the center of the beam.  The achieved collapse load is 69 . 8  kN , 1.7% less than a reference value ( 71  kN ) calculated using the uniaxial yielding stress, revealing the influence of the shear stress in the collapse.  The same pattern of steel cross section discretizations, used for the mechanical convergence analysis, are used to solve the thermal problem, now including the presence of concrete acting as a heat sink material, as shown in Fig. 31.    Fig. 32 shows the ISO 834 standard fire curve, which determines the ambient temperature evolution, and temperature of points A and B (see fig. 28) along time for both discretizations. The maximum time for thermal analysis (240min) was adopted considering the double of the maximum required fire resistance time found in design codes. As one can see no sensible difference among the presented results for both discretizations is achieved, revealing the very good convergence of the thermal problem when using the adopted cubic finite element.  Based on the achieved results, it is evident that the difference between the top and bottom temperatures has a large dependence regarding time. Which means that, for this case, the use of a simplified temperature profile during the heating is not an option, especially when considering the initial time, until 120min, the maximum found in design codes.  As simplified temperatures profile does not apply for this case, we present a complete thermo-mechanical analysis to serve as a reference for further works and also to perform a final convergence analysis. In order to do so, the CEN EN 1993-1-2:2005 [30] temperature dependence of the constitutive model and relative thermal elongation for steel at high temperatures are considered. From these considerations, the temperature profile for the steel cross section achieved by the previous thermal analysis is used to model the simple supported beam indicated in Fig. 28 subjected to a transverse load of F = 60  kN .    Fig. 33 shows the vertical displacement versus time and indicates that the collapse occurs in 25min. Moreover, the convergence is also characterized as the use of the very poor discretization presents practically the same result as the one achieved by the final discretization of the thermal and mechanical convergence analyses.   CONCLUSIONS   In this study we successfully apply a new geometrical nonlinear formulation, based on positions, to model three-dimensional frame structures under high temperatures (fire). The formulation is geometrically exact and does not use finite rotation, but generalized vectors, to represent large displacements and rotations for frame analysis. A two-dimensional nonlinear thermal module of analysis is developed and implemented to solve the cross section temperature profile.  The three-dimensional thermo-mechanical coupling is developed adjusting, at the equivalent stress space, the stress\u2013strain diagrams following standardized reduction factors. Moreover the adjustment of internal force, respecting the yielding surface at any temperature, is proposed and successfully tested. Numerical implementations have been carried out resulting in the SYSAF package. Various examples are solved, comparing results with experimental and other numerical methods, confirming that the proposed formulation is able to solve steel structures in fire.

REFERENCES", "highlights": "This study presents the development of a finite element formulation based on positions to deal with steel structures under high temperatures. The nonlinear thermal analysis is done regarding cross sections using two-dimensional flat elements while the three dimensional structural members are modeled by physical and geometrical nonlinear solid-like frame elements of any order. The thermal analysis consists in achieving, along time, the temperature profile at frame elements cross sections that affects the constitutive relations and, consequently, residual stresses at the structural mechanical equilibrium. The proposed element presents a geometrically exact description for large displacements and rotations by means of translations and generalized vectors nodal parameters. The adopted three dimensional Thermo-elastoplastic constitutive relation is based on the von Mises yielding surface for which the temperature dependence is established and an alternative flow rule is developed. Several examples are presented in order to validate the formulation and to show its good results."}
