The consistency of the corrected nodal derivatives are theoretically proved.      The superiority of the QC1 scheme is sufficiently demonstrated.          KEYPHRASES   Meshfree/meshless  Element-free Galerkin (EFG)  One-point integration  Three-dimensional  Hu\u2013Washizu  Consistency   Meshfree methods which do not need a pre-defined mesh to construct approximation functions have achieved remarkable progress in the past twenty years and many kinds of methods have been proposed such as the diffuse element method (DEM) by Nayroles et al. [1], the reproducing kernel particle method (RKPM) by Liu et al. [2], the finite point method by O\u00f1ate et al. [3], the maximum entropy approach by Sukumar [4] and the radial point interpolation method (RPIM) by Liu et al. [5\u20137], etc. Among them, the element-free Galerkin (EFG) method invented by Belytschko and coworkers [8] is one of the most successful meshfree methods and is widely used in various applications such as advancing cracks [9,10], bending plates [11,12] and moving flows [13,14] etc.  In EFG, the meshfree approximation is constructed by moving least-squares (MLS) [8] which needs only a set of scattered nodes. The pre-defined elements with explicit nodal connectivity are not needed. This gives EFG apparent advantages in large deformation analysis as well as in the implementation of h-adaptivity. In addition, the MLS approximation functions are much smoother than the Lagrange interpolation functions of the traditional finite element methods (FEM) and thus possess much better convergence, especially in stress/strain fields. Even more important, high order approximation can be conveniently constructed by MLS and there is no need at all for high order elements such as 20-node hexahedrons. Due to these advantages, EFG has the potential to challenge the dominance of the traditional FEM in engineering analysis.  However, the low efficiency of the EFG method impedes its wide acceptance in industry. The primary cause of inefficiency is that the MLS approximants are non-polynomial rational functions and require much more evaluation points to integrate the Galerkin weak form. Otherwise, instability or inaccuracy will appear. Besides, the misalignment of the integration cells with the nodal supports also causes considerable integration errors, as demonstrated by Dolbow and Belytschko [15].  Strategies to reduce the number of integration points for meshfree methods are extensively investigated and several kinds of methods are developed, such as the stress-point integration [16,17], the support domain integration [18,19], and so on. The major method developed for this purpose is the nodal integration in which the integration points and the approximation nodes coincide. It is noted that nodal integration is one-point integration since in each integration sub-domain (cell) only the approximation node associated to this cell is employed as the quadrature point.  Beissel and Belytschko [20] first presented the idea of nodal integration and they found that it is not stable. Hence, a least-square stabilization term is introduced into the weak form. Stability is improved with this additional term, however, it impairs the accuracy of the method. What is more, an artificial parameter is involved and it depends on numerical experiments. Nagashima [21] introduced stabilization terms by a Taylor series expansion of the stiffness matrix such that no artificial parameter is needed. Liu et al. [22] also used this technique to stabilize the nodal integration of the radial point interpolation method (RPIM) and higher order Taylor expansion is employed. However, spurious oscillations still may present, especially in stress fields [17].  So far, the most widely applied one-point integration in meshfree fields is the stabilized conforming nodal integration (SCNI) proposed by Chen et al. [23\u201325]. They presented an integration constraint (IC) according to the satisfaction of the linear patch test condition and developed a strain smoothing technique to exactly meet IC. Linear patch test is exactly passed by SCNI and therefore it results even better accuracy than that of Gauss integration which cannot pass linear patch test exactly. However, the strain smoothing in SCNI can only reproduce a constant strain field for each background integration cell. Therefore, this technique is not adequate for high order meshfree approximation which requires linear and even higher order strain field should be exactly reproduced. Duan et al. [26] proposed a consistency framework for meshfree nodal derivatives according to the divergence theorem and under this framework developed a quadratically consistent three-point integration scheme (QC3) which can exactly reproduce linear strain fields by correcting the nodal derivatives at quadrature points. For second order meshfree approximation, accuracy, convergence and efficiency are tremendously improved by QC3 in comparison to those of SCNI. The perfect numerical performance of QC3 is also verified by Sukumar [27] who proposed quadratic serendipity shape functions and used QC3 as the integration scheme. The mathematic theory permitting the use of such corrected nodal derivatives in QC3 is described in [28] and the extension of QC3 to three-dimensional elastic and elastoplastic problems is given in [29]. Recently, Ortiz-Bernardin et al. [30] employed QC3 for nearly-incompressible elasticity and also extended it to large deformation analysis [31]. They demonstrated the superiorities of QC3, such as high accuracy, smooth stress fields, etc., in comparison to other integration methods. However, QC3 is not one-point integration approach.  The consistency framework mentioned above contains two kinds of consistencies, one is called the differentiation of the approximation consistency (DAC) which is the derivative of the reproducing condition (the approximation completeness), and the other one is called the discrete divergence consistency (DDC) which is the discrete form of the divergence theorem between a nodal shape function and its derivative. It is noted that the standard derivatives of the nodal MLS shape functions are computed only by the satisfaction of the DAC and they violate the DDC. In contrast, the corrected derivatives used in QC3 are computed by the satisfaction of the DDC and it can be theoretically proved that they also meet the DAC, i.e. in QC3 both the DAC and the DDC are satisfied. For second order meshfree approximation in 2D, the DDC provides three equations to determine the corrected nodal derivatives and thus the three-point integration scheme can be straightforwardly designed, i.e. the QC3 method. To further develop a one-point integration scheme, Duan et al. [32] introduced the high order derivatives into the DDC by Taylor series expansion and used the three equations to determine one first-order and two second-order derivatives at the center of each background integration cell. In this way, the QC3 can be transformed into a one-point integration scheme which still possesses quadratic exactness, i.e. it is able to pass quadratic patch test exactly and thus it is named as QC1. However, so far this method is limited to two dimensional problems.  The purpose of this paper is to extend the QC1 method to 3D. It is noted that most real industrial problems are in 3D instead of in 2D. More importantly, standard meshfree methods employ much more integration points in 3D than in 2D and thus the issue of inefficiency is much more severe for three-dimensional meshfree methods. For example,  5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5  Gauss points in each background cell are employed in the three-dimensional EFG method [33] and its accuracy is still not satisfactory. In contrast, the developed three-dimensional QC1 method employs only 1 integration point in each cell (i.e. its center) and meanwhile results very high accuracy. This demonstrates the significance of the proposed extension of the QC1 method for 3D meshfree analysis, especially for the application of the meshfree methods to real industrial problems. To our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first one-point integration scheme for 3D meshfree Galerkin methods which results second order exactness.  The structure of the remaining paper is as follows. The three-dimensional EFG method is first briefly reviewed in Section 2. The derivation of the formulation for nodal derivative correction based on the Hu\u2013Washizu three-field variational principle is described in Section 3. The proposed three-dimensional quadratically consistent one-point (QC1) integration scheme using background tetrahedral cell is given in Section 4. The quadratic consistency of the corrected nodal derivatives are proved in Section 5. Numerical validation is presented in Section 6 followed by the conclusion in Section 7.  As one of the major meshfree methods in the literature, the EFG method uses the moving-least squares (MLS) approximation to construct the nodal shape functions. Given a set of nodes   X   I   in the domain  \u03a9 \u2282   R  3   , the MLS approximation of the displacement is  (1)     u  h   ( x )  = N  ( x )  U =   \u2211 I     N   I    ( x )    U   I        where U is the vector of nodal displacement parameters and    U   I   =   [        u   I         v   I         w   I        ]  T   . The MLS nodal shape function    N   I    ( x )   can be written as  (2)     N   I    ( x )  =   p  T   (    X   I    )    w   I    ( x )  \u03b1  ( x )     where  p  ( x )   is the vector of basis functions and    w   I    ( x )   is a weight function. In this study, they are, respectively, provided by  (3)   p  ( x )  =   [     1   x   y   z     1 2    x  2       1 2    y  2       1 2    z  2      x y     y z     z x      ]    T      and  (4)     w   I    ( x )  = w  (  s \u00af  )  =  {          e   \u2212   (     s \u00af    \u03b1    )  2    \u2212   e   \u2212   (   1  \u03b1    )  2      1 \u2212   e   \u2212   (   1  \u03b1    )  2          for   s \u00af  \u2264 1      0    for   s \u00af  > 1          where   s \u00af  =  s / r   , r is the radius of influence or support domain of a node,  s =  |  x \u2212   X   I    |   is the distance from a point x to a node   X   I   and the parameter  \u03b1 =  1 / 3   .  The unknown coefficients vector  \u03b1  ( x )   is determined by the consistency condition (the reproducing condition) of the approximation  (5)   p  ( x )  =   \u2211 I   p  (    X   I    )    N   I    ( x )          Substitution of Eq. (2) into Eq. (5) leads to  (6)   A  ( x )  \u03b1  ( x )  = p  ( x )     where the moment matrix is given by  (7)   A  ( x )  =   \u2211 I   p  (    X   I    )    p  T   (    X   I    )    w   I    ( x )          Apparently, the nodal MLS shape functions    N   I    ( x )   can be obtained by substituting the solution of Eq. (6) into Eq. (2). The spatial derivatives of the shape functions are  (8)     N   I ,  i    ( x )  =   p  T   (    X   I    )   [    w   I ,  i    ( x )  \u03b1  ( x )  +   w   I    ( x )    \u03b1   ,  i    ( x )   ]     where subscripts preceded by commas denote partial derivatives with respect to spatial coordinates, that is,    N   I ,  i    ( x )   is    N   I ,  x    ( x )   ,    N   I ,  y    ( x )   and    N   I ,  z    ( x )   for  i = 1 , 2 , 3  , respectively. The unknown vector    \u03b1   ,  i    ( x )   in Eq. (8) can be obtained by Eq. (6), that is  (9)   A  ( x )    \u03b1   ,  i    ( x )  =   p   ,  i    ( x )  \u2212   A   ,  i    ( x )  \u03b1  ( x )     where  (10)     A   ,  i    ( x )  =   \u2211 I   p  (    X   I    )    p  T   (    X   I    )    w   I ,  i    ( x )          Consider an elastostatic problem in a 3D domain \u03a9 boundary by \u0393 . The equation of equilibrium is  (11)   \u2207 \u22c5  \u03c3  +  b  = 0     in     \u03a9    where \u03c3 is the Cauchy stress tensor and b is the body force vector. The natural and essential boundary conditions are, respectively, given by  (12)    \u03c3  \u22c5  n  =   t   \u00af      on      \u0393   t         (13)    u  =   u   \u00af      on      \u0393   u      where the superposed bar indicates prescribed values, and  n =   [        n   x         n   y         n   z        ]  T   is the unit normal to the boundary.  The standard Galerkin weak form of the equilibrium equation along with the natural boundary condition is  (14)   \u03b4 \u03a0  ( u )  =   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4   \u03b5  T  D \u03b5  d \u03a9  \u2212   \u222b     \u0393   t      \u03b4   u  T   t \u00af  d \u0393  \u2212   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4   u  T  b d \u03a9     where D is the matrix of elastic modulus and the strain is  (15)   \u03b5 =   [        \u03b5   x x         \u03b5   y y         \u03b5   z z         \u03b3   x y         \u03b3   y z         \u03b3   z x        ]  T  = BU =   \u2211 I     B   I     U   I        with the matrix  (16)    B  =  [        B   1         B   2      \u22ef      B   n        ]     and      B   I   =   [        N   I , x      0   0      N   I , y      0      N   I , z        0      N   I , y      0      N   I , x         N   I , z      0     0   0      N   I , z      0      N   I , y         N   I , x        ]   T         Substitution of Eqs. (1) and (15) into Eq. (14) along with the arbitrariness of  \u03b4 U  leads to the discretized equation  (17)   KU = f    where the stiffness matrix and nodal force vector are, respectively  (18)     K   I J   =   \u222b   \u03a9      B   I   T   D   B   J   d \u03a9      f   I   =   \u222b   \u03a9      N   I   T   b d \u03a9  +   \u222b     \u0393   t        N   I   T    t \u00af  d \u0393        Note that the nodal MLS shape functions and their derivatives in Eq. (18) are non-polynomial rational functions which are very difficult to be accurately integrated. Consequently, numerous sampling points such as those in high order Gauss quadrature have to be used and this consumes an unacceptably high amount of CPU time. In fact, even the high order Gauss quadrature is still not able to numerically integrate the stiffness matrix and the nodal force vector in Eq. (18) exactly or accurately enough. This poses an essential difficulty in the application of the meshfree Galerkin methods to real three-dimensional engineering problems.  To reduce the number of sampling points and develop a stable one-point integration scheme for 3D EFG method, the derivative correction technique presented in [28] is used. We start from the Hu\u2013Washizu three-field variational principle of the elastostatic problem  (19)   \u03b4   \u03a0   H \u2212 W    (  u ,   \u03b5 \u02dc  ,   \u03c3 ^   )  =   \u222b   \u03a9     [  \u03b4    \u03b5 \u02dc   T   (  D  \u03b5 \u02dc  \u2212  \u03c3 ^   )  + \u03b4    \u03c3 ^   T   (  \u03b5 \u2212  \u03b5 \u02dc   )  + \u03b4   \u03b5  T   \u03c3 ^   ]   d \u03a9  \u2212   \u222b     \u0393   t      \u03b4   u  T   t \u00af  d \u0393  \u2212   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4   u  T  b d \u03a9     where the displacement u , the interpolated (or assumed) strain  \u03b5 \u02dc  and the assumed Cauchy stress  \u03c3 ^  are three independent variables. By rearrangement of the terms, Eq. (19) can be written as  (20)   \u03b4   \u03a0   H \u2212 W    (  u ,   \u03b5 \u02dc  ,   \u03c3 ^   )  =   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4    \u03b5 \u02dc   T  D  \u03b5 \u02dc  d \u03a9  \u2212   \u222b     \u0393   t      \u03b4   u  T   t \u00af  d \u0393  \u2212   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4   u  T  b d \u03a9  + \u03b4  [    \u222b   \u03a9       \u03c3 ^   T   (  \u03b5 \u2212  \u03b5 \u02dc   )  d \u03a9   ]        Apparently, if the interpolated strain  \u03b5 \u02dc  is constructed based on the satisfaction of the following orthogonality condition:  (21)     \u222b   \u03a9       \u03c3 ^   T   (  \u03b5 \u2212  \u03b5 \u02dc   )  d \u03a9  = 0       Eq. (20) will reduce to  (22)   \u03b4   \u03a0   H \u2212 W   *    ( u )  =   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4    \u03b5 \u02dc   T  D  \u03b5 \u02dc  d \u03a9  \u2212   \u222b     \u0393   t      \u03b4   u  T   t \u00af  d \u0393  \u2212   \u222b   \u03a9    \u03b4   u  T  b d \u03a9     which has the same form as the standard Galerkin weak form, i.e. Eq. (14). The only difference is that the strain \u03b5 is replaced by the interpolated strain  \u03b5 \u02dc  in Eq. (22). If  \u03b5 \u02dc  can be constructed from the displacement field, then Eq. (22) is still a one-field weak form, that is, the displacement is the only one independent variable as in the standard Galerkin weak form. This remarkably simplifies the Hu\u2013Washizu weak form, i.e. Eq. (19), in which three independent variables present.  Now the question is how to meet Eq. (21) by constructing the interpolated strain  \u03b5 \u02dc  from the displacement field. The following is the reply to this question. Suppose the whole domain \u03a9 is divided into a set sub-domains (cells)   \u03a9   c   for the purpose of integration. To meet Eq. (21) in the whole domain \u03a9 , this equation should be met on each cell   \u03a9   c   , i.e.  (23)     \u222b     \u03a9   c         \u03c3 ^   T   (  \u03b5 \u2212  \u03b5 \u02dc   )  d \u03a9  = 0    where the interpolated strain  \u03b5 \u02dc  is approximated by the displacement as follows:  (24)    \u03b5 \u02dc  =   [         \u03b5 \u02dc    x x          \u03b5 \u02dc    y y          \u03b5 \u02dc    z z          \u03b3 \u02dc    x y          \u03b3 \u02dc    y z          \u03b3 \u02dc    z x        ]  T  =  B \u02dc  U =   \u2211 I      B \u02dc    I     U   I        with  (25)    B \u02dc  =  [         B \u02dc    1          B \u02dc    2      \u22ef       B \u02dc    n        ]     and  (26)      B \u02dc    I   =   [         N \u02dc    I , x      0   0       N \u02dc    I , y      0       N \u02dc    I , z        0       N \u02dc    I , y      0       N \u02dc    I , x          N \u02dc    I , z      0     0   0       N \u02dc    I , z      0       N \u02dc    I , y          N \u02dc    I , x        ]  T     where    N \u02dc    I , x   ,    N \u02dc    I , y   and    N \u02dc    I , z   are corrected nodal derivatives. They are not the standard nodal derivatives defined by Eq. (8) and it will be shown in the following that these corrected nodal derivatives are determined by the satisfaction of the orthogonality condition in each integration cell, i.e. Eq. (23).  Substitution of Eqs. (15) and (24) into Eq. (23) leads to  (27)   [    \u222b     \u03a9   c         \u03c3 ^   T    \u2211 I   (    B   I   \u2212    B \u02dc    I    )   d \u03a9   ]    U   I   = 0      Apparently, Eq. (27) will hold provided, for each node I , the following equation holds:  (28)     \u222b     \u03a9   c         \u03c3 ^   T   (    B   I   \u2212    B \u02dc    I    )  d \u03a9  = 0       Substituting Eqs. (16), (25) and (26) into Eq. (28) yields  (29)     \u222b     \u03a9   c         \u03c3 ^   T   (    N   I , i   \u2212    N \u02dc    I , i    )  d \u03a9  = 0    (  i = x , y , z  )        If the displacement is approximated by the MLS shape functions with the base  p  ( x )   , it is reasonable to assume  \u03c3 ^  is from the space spanned by the base  (30)   q  ( x )  =   p   , x    ( x )  \u222a   p   , y    ( x )  \u222a   p   , z    ( x )        It is clear that Eq. (29) will always hold provided the following equation holds:  (31)    \u222b    \u03a9   c      q  ( x )   (    N   I , i   \u2212    N \u02dc    I , i    )  d \u03a9  = 0    which by rearrangement can be rewritten as  (32)    \u222b    \u03a9   c      q  ( x )     N \u02dc    I , i   d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u03a9   c      q  ( x )    N   I , i   d \u03a9        Then the integration by parts of the r.h.s. of Eq. (32) yields  (33)    \u222b    \u03a9   c         N \u02dc    I , i     q  ( x )  d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  q  ( x )    n   i   d \u0393  \u2212  \u222b    \u03a9   c        N   I    ( x )    q   , i    ( x )  d \u03a9     where   \u0393   c   is the boundary of the cell   \u03a9   c   . This equation indicates a consistency requirement between the corrected nodal derivatives    N \u02dc    I , i   and the nodal shape functions   N   I   in terms of the divergence theorem. The discrete version of this equation, that is, the domain and contour integrals in the equation are evaluated numerically, is called in [26] the discrete divergence consistency (DDC) which is one of the two consistencies the corrected nodal derivatives should meet in order to exactly pass patch tests. The other consistency is called the differentiation of approximation consistency (DAC) which is the derivative of the reproducing condition (i.e. Eq. (5)) and can be written as  (34)    \u2211 I      N \u02dc    I , i    ( x )  p  (    X   I    )    =   p   , i    ( x )    for first order derivatives and  (35)    \u2211 I      N \u02dc    I , i j    ( x )  p  (    X   I    )    =   p   , i j    ( x )    for second order derivatives. Duan et al. [26,28] demonstrated both the DDC and the DAC should be met by the corrected nodal derivatives    N \u02dc    I , i   . Apparently, the standard nodal derivatives computed by Eqs. (8)\u2013(10) satisfy the DAC but violate the DDC. Hence, standard EFG method cannot exactly pass patch tests.  In the next section, we will design a one-point integration scheme in which the corrected nodal derivatives at quadrature points are computed based on Eq. (33) such that the DDC is satisfied. In Section 5, we will prove such corrected nodal derivatives also meet the DAC and thus patch tests can be exactly passed. This will be validated by numerical examples in Section 6.  To evaluate the domain integrals in the weak form, the whole computational domain is partitioned by background four-node tetrahedral elements and each element represents an integration sub-domain (cell), as shown in Fig. 1. The dark dots are approximation nodes and the blue squares denote the vertices of background integration mesh. In each integration cell, only its center is employed as cubature point (red star in Fig. 1) for domain integration and thus it is a one-point integration scheme. The four teal crosses on each surface of the tetrahedral cell are the quadrature points for boundary integration.  Apparently, in this one-point integration scheme, we only have one unknown, that is, the corrected nodal derivative    N \u02dc    I , i   at the center of each tetrahedral cell, which needs to be determined by Eq. (33). However, for the quadratic base vector  p  ( x )   (shown by Eq. (3)) considered in this study, we have  q  ( x )  =   [     1   x   y   z     ]  T   according to Eq. (30). Therefore, Eq. (33) actually contains four equations and as an example the equations of the x-derivatives can be written as  (36)    \u222b    \u03a9   c         N \u02dc    I , x   d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )    n   x   d \u0393        (37)    \u222b    \u03a9   c         N \u02dc    I , x   x d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  x   n   x   d \u0393  \u2212  \u222b    \u03a9   c        N   I    ( x )  d \u03a9        (38)    \u222b    \u03a9   c         N \u02dc    I , x   y d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  y   n   x   d \u0393        (39)    \u222b    \u03a9   c         N \u02dc    I , x   z d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  z   n   x   d \u0393        Obviously, one unknown cannot make all the four equations satisfied at the same time. If we solve the unknown    N \u02dc    I , x   only by Eq. (36) and discard the other three equations, then the method reduces to the SCNI-type of methods proposed by Chen et al. [23]. We name this kind of methods as linearly consistent 1-point (LC1) integration method in this study since it can exactly pass linear patch test but cannot pass the quadratic one as demonstrated in Section 6.  To introduce three more unknowns and make all the four equations, that is Eqs. (36)\u2013(39), satisfied, the following Taylor series expansion of    N \u02dc    I , x   is employed:  (40)      N \u02dc    I , x    ( x )  =    N \u02dc    I , x    (    x   c    )  +  (  x \u2212   x   c    )     N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )  +  (  y \u2212   y   c    )     N \u02dc    I , x y    (    x   c    )     +  (  z \u2212   z   c    )     N \u02dc    I , x z    (    x   c    )  + H .O .T    where    x   c   =  {        x   c         y   c         z   c        }   is the center of the background cell, i.e. the cubature point.     N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )   ,     N \u02dc    I , x y    (    x   c    )   and     N \u02dc    I , x z    (    x   c    )   in Eq. (40) are the introduced three unknowns. Substituting Eq. (40) into Eqs. (36)\u2013(39) and evaluating the domain integrals only at the center of the cell leads to  (41)   [     V   0   0   0      V   x   c         I   c   x x         I   c   x y         I   c   x z         V   y   c         I   c   x y         I   c   y y         I   c   y z         V   z   c         I   c   x z         I   c   y z         I   c   z z        ]   {         N \u02dc    I , x    (    x   c    )           N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )           N \u02dc    I , x y    (    x   c    )           N \u02dc    I , x z    (    x   c    )       }  =  {       \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )    n   x   d \u0393         \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  x   n   x   d \u0393  \u2212  \u222b    \u03a9   c        N   I    ( x )  d \u03a9         \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  y   n   x   d \u0393         \u222b    \u0393   c        N   I    ( x )  z   n   x   d \u0393       }    where  V =  \u222b    \u03a9   c      d \u03a9   is the volume of the cell   \u03a9   c   and\u00a0the second order volume moments of   \u03a9   c   are  (42)     I   c   x x   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c        (  x \u2212   x   c    )  2  d \u03a9     I   c   y y   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c        (  y \u2212   y   c    )  2  d \u03a9     I   c   z z   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c        (  z \u2212   z   c    )  2  d \u03a9    I   c   x y   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  x \u2212   x   c    )   (  y \u2212   y   c    )  d \u03a9     I   c   y z   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  y \u2212   y   c    )   (  z \u2212   z   c    )  d \u03a9     I   c   z x   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  z \u2212   z   c    )   (  x \u2212   x   c    )  d \u03a9        Note that the first order volume moments with respect to the cell center   x   c   equal to zero, i.e.  (43)     I   c   x   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  x \u2212   x   L    )  d \u03a9  = 0    I   c   y   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  y \u2212   y   c    )  d \u03a9  = 0    I   c   z   =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       (  z \u2212   z   c    )  d \u03a9  = 0       To accurately evaluate the domain integral of    N   I    ( x )   on the r.h.s. of Eq.

Hence, the simplified weak form, i.e. Eq. (22), can be used, which naturally introduce the corrected nodal derivatives into the weak form. This leads to the final discretized system equation  (49)    K \u02dc  U = f    where  (50)    K \u02dc  =  \u222b \u03a9      B \u02dc   T  D  B \u02dc  d \u03a9    f =  \u222b \u03a9     N  T  b d \u03a9  +  \u222b    \u0393   t        N  T   t \u00af  d \u0393     and the matrix  B \u02dc  is given by Eq.

To introduce the second order corrected nodal derivatives into the discretized system equation, Taylor series expansion of the stiffness matrix is employed such that the  (  I , J  )  component of the stiffness matrix contributed from the cell   \u03a9   c   is computed as follows:  (51)      K \u02dc    I J     \u03a9   c     =  \u222b    \u03a9   c         B \u02dc    I   T   D    B \u02dc    J   d \u03a9  =  \u222b    \u03a9   c       [     B \u02dc    I   T   +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T     \u2202 x    (  x \u2212   x   c    )  +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T     \u2202 y    (  y \u2212   y   c    )  +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T     \u2202 z    (  z \u2212   z   c    )   ]  D  \u00d7  [     B \u02dc    J   +   \u2202    B \u02dc    J     \u2202 x    (  x \u2212   x   c    )  +   \u2202    B \u02dc    J     \u2202 y    (  y \u2212   y   c    )  +   \u2202    B \u02dc    J   T     \u2202 z    (  z \u2212   z   c    )   ]  d \u03a9 = V    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )  D    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   x x     \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   +   I   c   y y     \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y   +   I   c   z z     \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z   +   I   c   x y    [    \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y   +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x    ]  +   I   c   y z    [    \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z   +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 y    ]  +   I   c   z x    [    \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   +   \u2202    B \u02dc    I   T    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   D   \u2202    B \u02dc    J    (    x   c    )    \u2202 z    ]     where    B \u02dc    I   is given by Eq.

Apparently, the derivative of    B \u02dc    I   is constructed by the second order corrected nodal derivatives, for example, we have  (52)      \u2202    B \u02dc    I    (    x   c    )    \u2202 x   =   [         N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )     0   0       N \u02dc    I , y x    (    x   c    )     0       N \u02dc    I , z x    (    x   c    )       0       N \u02dc    I , y x    (    x   c    )     0       N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )         N \u02dc    I , z x    (    x   c    )     0     0   0       N \u02dc    I , z x    (    x   c    )     0       N \u02dc    I , y x    (    x   c    )         N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )       ]  T        Similarly, on   \u03a9   c   the body force is evaluated by  (53)     f   b     \u03a9   c     =  \u222b    \u03a9   c        N  T  b d \u03a9  =    V   N  T  b  |   x c   +  1 2    I   c   x x          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202   x  2     |     x   c       (  x \u2212   x   c    )  2  +  1 2    I   c   y y          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202   y  2     |     x   c       (  y \u2212   y   c    )  2  +  1 2    I   c   z z          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202   z  2     |     x   c       (  z \u2212   z   c    )  2  +   I   c   x y          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202 x \u2202 y    |     x   c      (  x \u2212   x   c    )   (  y \u2212   y   c    )  +   I   c   y z          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202 y \u2202 z    |     x   c      (  y \u2212   y   c    )   (  z \u2212   z   c    )  +   I   c   z x          \u2202  2  (   N  T  b )   \u2202 z \u2202 x    |     x   c      (  z \u2212   z   c    )   (  x \u2212   x   c    )        In summary, the proposed QC1 method computes the stiffness matrix and body force according to Eqs. (51) and\u00a0(53), respectively, by using the corrected nodal derivatives which are determined by Eqs. (46)\u2013(48). To check the stability of the developed QC1 method, an eigen value analysis of its stiffness matrix is performed on a  2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2  domain with  11 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 11  nodes. Only six zero eigenvalues are found which corresponds to the six regular rigid body modes. The seventh smallest eigen value is non-zero which is associated with two deformation modes which are shown in Fig. 2. This indicates that the proposed QC1 method has no spurious zero-energy modes (hourglass modes).  As mentioned above, nodal derivatives at integration points should meet both the DDC and the DAC in order to exactly pass patch tests [26,28]. The corrected nodal derivatives given by Eqs. (46)\u2013(48) meet the DDC since they are computed based on the satisfaction of this condition. However, it is still unknown whether they meet the DAC (i.e. Eqs. (35) and (36))? In the following we will prove that the DAC is also satisfied at cubature points by these corrected nodal derivatives.  For ease of presentation, we introduce the following expression for the quadratic base vector in Eq. (3):   (54)   p  ( x )  =   [     1   x   y   z     1 2    x  2       1 2    y  2       1 2    z  2      x y     y z     z x      ]  T  =   [        p   1    ( x )        p   2    ( x )     \u22ef      p   10    ( x )       ]  T     such that the consistency condition for nodal shape functions    N   I    ( x )   , i.e. Eq. (5), can be rewritten in the following component format:  (55)    \u2211  I = 1  n     N   I    ( x )    p   j    (    X   I    )   =   p   j    ( x )     (  j = 1 ~ 10  )     and correspondingly, Eqs. (34) and (35) which are the DAC for quadratic approximation can be written as (at integration points   x   c   )  (56)    \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I ,  i    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )   =   p   j ,  i    (    x   c    )    (  j = 1 ~ 10  )        (57)    \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I ,  i k    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )   =   p   j ,  i k    (    x   c    )    (  j = 1 ~ 10  )     where   i ,   k = 1 , 2 , 3  denote x , y and z , respectively.  We only give the proof of Eqs. (56) and (57) with   i = 1  , i.e. the x-derivatives. The proof for the case   i = 2 , 3  is similar and thus is omitted. We multiply    p   j    (    X   I    )   at both sides of Eq. (46) and then do the summation over I .

(61) is due to the fact that the nodal shape functions satisfy Eq. (55) and the standard nodal derivatives meet the DAC. It is noted that    p   j    ( x )   is a up to second order monomial function and its domain integral can be exactly evaluated by the proposed one-point integration scheme with Taylor expansion. This is the reason for the last equal sign in Eq. (61). Also note that the boundary integrals of up to third order polynomials can be exactly evaluated by the four integration points on each surface of the integration cell. Thus, Eq. (60) can be transformed from the discrete summation form to the following continuous integration form:  (62)     {        f   1   x           f   2   x           f   3   x           f   4   x        }    =  {       \u222b    \u0393   c        p   j    ( x )    n   x   d \u0393         \u222b    \u0393   c        p   j    ( x )  x   n   x   d \u0393  \u2212  \u222b    \u03a9   c        p   j    ( x )  d \u03a9         \u222b    \u0393   S        p   j    ( x )  y   n   x   d \u0393         \u222b    \u0393   S        p   j    ( x )  z   n   x   d \u0393       }  =  {       \u222b    \u03a9   c        p   j , x    ( x )  d \u03a9         \u222b    \u03a9   c        p   j , x    ( x )  x d \u03a9         \u222b    \u03a9   c        p   j , x    ( x )  y d \u03a9         \u222b    \u03a9   c        p   j , x    ( x )  z d \u03a9       }        The last equal sign in Eq. (62) is due to the divergence theorem. It is stressed that the derivation from Eqs. (60) to (62) requires that the boundary integration scheme must exactly integrate third order polynomials. Consequently, the number of integration points on each cell surface should not be less than 4.  The integrand on r.h.s. of Eq. (62) is up to second order monomial function and thus its domain integration can be exactly evaluated by the proposed integration scheme, that is  (63)   {        f   1   x           f   2   x           f   3   x           f   4   x        }    =   {      V   p   j , x    (    x   c    )        V   x   c     p   j , x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   x x     p   j , x x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   x y     p   j , x y    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   z x     p   j , x z    (    x   c    )        V   y   c     p   j , x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   x y     p   j , x x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   y y     p   j , x y    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   y z     p   j , x z    (    x   c    )        V   z   c     p   j , x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   z x     p   j , x x    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   y z     p   j , x y    (    x   c    )  +   I   c   z z     p   j , x z    (    x   c    )       }       Substitution of Eq.

(64) can be computed as  (65)   |     V   0   0   0      V   x   c         I   c   x x         I   c   x y         I   c   z x         V   y   c         I   c   x y         I   c   y y         I   c   y z         V   z   c         I   c   z x         I   c   y z         I   c   z z        |  = V  |        I   c   x x         I   c   x y         I   c   z x           I   c   x y         I   c   y y         I   c   y z           I   c   z x         I   c   y z         I   c   z z        |       Apparently, the determinant is not equal to zero provided that the volume of the integration cell is not zero, that is, the cell does not degenerate to surface. This ensures the full rank of the system matrix of Eq. (64) and its unique solution is  (66)   {       \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I , x    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )          \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )          \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I , x y    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )          \u2211  I = 1  n      N \u02dc    I , x z    (    x   c    )    p   j    (    X   I    )        }  =   {        p   j , x    (    x   c    )          p   j , x x    (    x   c    )          p   j , x y    (    x   c    )          p   j , x z    (    x   c    )       }    which demonstrates that     N \u02dc    I , x    (    x   c    )   ,     N \u02dc    I , x x    (    x   c    )   ,     N \u02dc    I , x y    (    x   c    )   and     N \u02dc    I , x z    (    x   c    )   satisfy the quadratic DAC, i.e. Eqs. (56) and (57) with   i = 1  . This completes our proof.  Based on the above exposition, the developed three-dimensional QC1 method satisfies both the quadratic DAC and the quadratic DDC. Hence, it is quadratically consistent and can exactly pass quadratic patch test. This will be numerically validated in the next section.  The performance of the proposed QC1 method in meshfree analysis of three-dimensional elastostatic problems are investigated by the following six numerical examples. In all the examples, linear elastic material with Young\u05f3s modulus  E =   10  7   Pa  and Poisson\u05f3s ratio  \u03c5 = 0.3  are assumed. MLS approximation with quadratic base vector shown by Eq. (3) is adopted. The essential boundary conditions are imposed by the Nitsche\u05f3s method [34]. The boundary integrals present in the Nitsche\u05f3s method as well as in the computation of the applied force on Neumann boundaries are numerically integrated by the standard Gauss integration using four quadrature points per surface triangle element. Note that this is the same boundary integration scheme as the one used to evaluate the corrected nodal derivatives, see Fig. 1.  For the purpose of comparison, the existing linearly consistent one-point (LC1) integration scheme which corresponds to SCNI [23\u201325] is also implemented. The method use the same integration cell and evaluation points as the proposed QC1, but the corrected nodal derivatives at cubature points are computed based on the discrete form of Eq. (33) with  q  ( x )  \u2261 1  , i.e. the linear DDC. Apparently, in this case the second term on the r.h.s. of Eq. (33) disappears. It is noted that, so far LC1 is the most popular one-point integration scheme for meshfree methods. Besides, standard tetrahedral (ST) integration scheme with 1, 15 and 24 cubature points per cell are also implemented and they are denoted as ST1, ST15 and ST24, respectively. Note that these methods employ standard nodal derivatives computed by Eqs. (8)\u2013(10) at cubature points.  The numerical errors in displacement and energy are, respectively, evaluated by  (67)     E   disp   =      \u2211  I = 1  n     (    u   I   h   \u2212   u   I   e    )  T   (    u   I   h   \u2212   u   I   e    )      \u2211  I = 1  n     u   I     e  T      u   I   e              (68)     E   eng   =      \u222b \u03a9     (    \u03b5  h  \u2212   \u03b5  e   )  T  D  (    \u03b5  h  \u2212   \u03b5  e   )  d \u03a9     \u222b \u03a9     \u03b5   e T   D   \u03b5  e  d \u03a9         where the superscripts e and h denote the exact (analytical) and the numerical solutions, respectively. The domain integrals in Eq. (68) are evaluated by 24 integration points in each background tetrahedral cell. The desktop PC with Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Quad CPU Q9500 @ 2.83GHz is used to run all the examples.  Patch tests are first investigated on a  2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2  domain with 155 nodes. In the linear patch test, all the boundary displacements are prescribed as  (69)    u \u00af  =  {      0.1 + 0.1 x + 0.2 y + 0.2 z          0.05 + 0.15 x + 0.1 y + 0.2 z     0.05 + 0.1 x + 0.2 y + 0.2 z         }        The analytical solution is  u =  u \u00af   in the absence of body force. In the quadratic patch test, the displacement is prescribed at the boundaries as  (70)     u \u00af  ^  =  {      0.1 + 0.2 x + 0.2 y + 0.1 z + 0.15   x  2  + 0.2   y  2  + 0.1   z  2  + 0.15 x y + 0.1 y z + 0.1 z x          0.15 + 0.1 x + 0.1 y + 0.2 z + 0.2   x  2  + 0.15   y  2  + 0.1   z  2  + 0.2 x y + 0.1 y z + 0.2 z x     0.15 + 0.15 x + 0.2 y + 0.1 z + 0.15   x  2  + 0.1   y  2  + 0.2   z  2  + 0.1 x y + 0.2 y z + 0.15 z x         }        The analytical solution is  u =   u \u00af  ^   when the following body force is applied:  (71)   b =  {      \u2212 0.3 D  (  1 , 1  )  \u2212 0.2 D  (  1 , 2  )  \u2212 0.15 D  (  1 , 3  )  \u2212 0.6 D  (  4 , 4  )  \u2212 0.35 D  (  6 , 6  )           \u2212 0.15 D  (  2 , 1  )  \u2212 0.3 D  (  2 , 2  )  \u2212 0.2 D  (  2 , 3  )  \u2212 0.55 D  (  4 , 4  )  \u2212 0.4 D  (  5 , 5  )      \u2212 0.1 D  (  1 , 1  )  \u2212 0.1 D  (  1 , 2  )  \u2212 0.4 D  (  1 , 3  )  \u2212 0.3 D  (  5 , 5  )  \u2212 0.4 D  (  6 , 6  )          }     where D is the  6 \u00d7 6  elastic modulus matrix.    Tables 1 and 2 list the results of the linear and quadratic patch tests, respectively. As the theoretic prediction given above, the proposed QC1 exactly passed both tests since the errors are extremely small. LC1, as the dominant one-point integration technique for meshfree methods, only passed the linear patch test whereas failed to pass the quadratic one. Note that QC1 satisfies both the DAC and the DDC up to the second order whereas LC1 only meets the linear DAC and the linear DDC. This verifies that satisfaction of both the DAC and the DDC is the sufficient condition for exactly passing the corresponding patch tests. ST1, ST15 and ST24 result relatively large errors both in displacement and in energy, therefore they fail to pass both patch tests. These conclusions are identical with those of 2D studies [26,28].  A circular plate in bending is next examined. As shown in Fig. 3, the plate is simply supported on the whole boundary and is subjected to a uniform load q on its upper surface. In this study, we set its radius  a = 10  m  , thickness  t = 0.5  m  and the load  q = 1000  Pa  .  The analytical deflection to this problem according to the Kirchhoff theory is given in [35].  (72)   w =   q  (    a  2  \u2212   r  2   )    64 D    (    5 + \u03bd   1 + \u03bd     a  2  \u2212   r  2   )     and the maximum deflection is at the center of the plate and given by  (73)     w   max   =  q  64 D     5 + \u03bd   1 + \u03bd     a  4     where D is flexural rigidity of the plate  (74)   D =   E   t  3    12  (  1 \u2212   \u03bd  2   )          Four grids which respectively have 395, 1335, 2028 and 4697 approximation nodes are employed to run this example and the relative errors of the maximum deflection resulting from all the tested methods are listed in Table 3. The proposed QC1 results the same accuracy as those of the ST15 and ST24, but consumes much less CPU time as shown in Fig. 4. The other two one-point integration methods, i.e. ST1 and LC1, result much larger errors and almost lose convergence in Fig. 4. Apparently, the developed QC1 is the most efficient method in view of both the accuracy and the consumed CPU time.  A hollow sphere subject to internal pressure is next considered. As shown in Fig. 5, only one-eighth of the sphere is modeled due to three-fold symmetry. The exact solution of the displacement is  (75)   {        u   r   =    (  1 + \u03bd  )  r  E     (        b  3    2   r  3    +   1 \u2212 2 \u03bd   1 + \u03bd         b  3      a  3    \u2212 1     p   i    )          u   \u03b8   =   u   \u03d5   = 0         and the exact stress is  (76)     \u03c3   r   =       b  3      r  3    \u2212 1       b  3      a  3    \u2212 1     p   i       \u03c3   \u03b8   =   \u03c3   \u03d5   =       b  3    2   r  3    + 1       b  3      a  3    \u2212 1     p   i      where   p   i   , a and b are internal pressure, the internal and outer radii, respectively. In this study    p   i   = 0.5  MPa  ,  a = 1  m  and  b = 2  m  are employed.  Five grids which, respectively, contain 49, 259, 366, 791 and 2473 nodes are used for convergence study and the results are plot in Fig. 6. The proposed QC1 not only dramatically reduces the number of domain integration points but also results even better accuracy and convergence than ST15 and ST24. In contrast, although LC1 is much better than ST1 which results huge errors and thus is omitted in Fig. 6, it is not as accurate as ST15 and ST24, let alone its comparison with the proposed QC1.    Fig. 7 plots the   \u03c3   x y   fields obtained by the five methods. QC1 shows a perfectly smooth stress distribution which is identical to those of ST15 and ST24. Note that QC1 only employs about one twentieth of integration points used by the latter. The stress field by LC1 is much better than that of ST1, but still shows mild oscillations and is obviously not as smooth as that of QC1.  A pressurized hollow cylinder as shown in Fig. 8 is next investigated. The analytical solution to this problem is  (77)   {        u   r   =  1 E     [     (  1 \u2212 \u03bd  )   (    a  2    p   i   \u2212   b  2    p   o    )      b  2  \u2212   a  2    r +    (  1 + \u03bd  )    a  2    b  2   (    p   i   \u2212   p   o    )      b  2  \u2212   a  2     1 r   ]          u   \u03b8   = 0         where   p   i   and   p   o   are the internal and external pressure, a and b are the internal and outer radii, respectively. In this study,    p   i   = 1000  pa  ,    p   o   = 500  pa  ,  a = 1  m  and  b = 2  m  are employed.  Due to two-fold symmetry, only the first quadrant with length  L = 1  is modeled. Six grids with 158, 290, 529, 1713, 2941 and 5270 nodes are, respectively, employed in numerical study. The performance in convergence and efficiency of the five tested methods together with the linear finite element method (LFEM) which employs the same grids is compared in Figs. 9 and 10, respectively. Once again, the proposed QC1 is the most accurate and efficient method with highest convergence rates both in displacement and in energy. Its performance in accuracy, convergence and efficiency is much better than that of LC1 which so far prevails in meshfree methods. It is also noted that, for the same grid, the LFEM is of course the fastest method. However, its accuracy and convergence rates are not satisfactory and actually they are only comparable to those of the standard meshfree methods with ST1 integration scheme, let alone the comparison with the developed QC1 scheme.  The   \u03c3   y y   stress fields are compared in Fig. 11. For this problem, only the proposed QC1 shows perfectly smooth stress distribution. Even the ST24 displays oscillations in stress field. LC1 also shows very evident oscillations. This demonstrates the significance of the proposed QC1 method for high order meshfree computations.  Besides, this example is also employed to test the influence of the boundary quadrature on the accuracy and convergence of the QC1 method. The results are shown in Fig. 12. As mentioned at the beginning of this section, for all the examples, four quadrature points per surface triangle element are employed to compute the integration along the essential and Neumann boundaries and this scheme is denoted as QC1_U4_T4 in Fig. 12. To test other boundary quadrature scheme, we first increase the quadrature points on Neumann boundaries to 16 per element which is denoted as QC1_U4_T16 in Fig. 12. Apparently, this substantially decreases the accuracy and convergence rates of the QC1 method (see the difference between QC1_U4_T16 and QC1_U4_T4 in Fig. 12). On the other hand, increase of the quadrature points on essential boundaries to 16 per element (i.e. QC1_U16_T4 in Fig. 12) will also cause the decrease in accuracy and convergence, but it is not as evident as that for Neumann boundaries. In fact, even 3 quadrature points per element on the essential boundaries can get comparable results with those of QC1_U4_T4. Of course, if we use only 1 quadrature point per element on essential boundaries, large errors will occur in QC1 as shown by the QC1_U1_T4 in Fig. 12.  It is noted that four quadrature points per surface triangle element are employed in the computation of the corrected derivatives, or more precisely, in the evaluation of the boundary integrals in Eqs. (36)\u2013(39). This is consistent (identical) to the QC1_U4_T4 scheme which obtained the best results in Fig. 12. Consequently, such consistency seems also critical to the performance of the QC1 method. Violation of this consistency will cause the decrease in accuracy and convergence rates, especially the integration along Neumann boundaries is very sensitive to this consistency.  The body force does not present in the last four examples, except in the quadratic patch test where the body force is constant. The purpose of this example is to further investigate the numerical performance of the proposed QC1 method when a non-constant body force presents.  This example is manufactured with the body force given by  (78)   {        b   x   =  [  D  (  1 , 1  )  + D  (  4 , 4  )  + D  (  6 , 6  )   ]  sin  x  cos  y  sin  z         b   y   =  [  D  (  2 , 1  )  + D  (  4 , 4  )   ]  cos  x  sin  y  sin  z +  [  D  (  5 , 5  )  \u2212 D  (  2 , 2  )   ]    e  y   cos  z         b   z   = \u2212  [  D  (  3 , 1  )  + D  (  6 , 6  )   ]  cos  x c o y  cos  z +  [  D  (  3 , 2  )  + D  (  5 , 5  )   ]    e  y   sin  z + D  (  3 , 3  )  sin  z            The exact displacement to this problem is  (79)     u   x   =  sin  x  cos  y  sin  z ,     u   y   =   e  y   cos  z ,     u   z   =  sin  z    and the exact stress is  (80)   {        \u03c3   x x           \u03c3   y y           \u03c3   z z           \u03c3   x y           \u03c3   y z           \u03c3   z x        }  =  {      D  (  1 , 1  )  cos  x  cos  y  sin  z + D  (  1 , 2  )    e  y   cos  z + D  (  1 , 3  )  cos  z       D  (  2 , 1  )  cos  x  cos  y  sin  z + D  (  2 , 2  )    e  y   cos  z + D  (  2 , 3  )  cos  z       D  (  3 , 1  )  cos  x  cos  y  sin  z + D  (  3 , 2  )    e  y   cos  z + D  (  3 , 3  )  cos  z       D  (  4 , 4  )   (  \u2212  sin  x  sin  y  sin  z  )        D  (  5 , 5  )   (  \u2212   e  y   sin  z  )        D  (  6 , 6  )  sin  x  cos  y  cos  z      }       The solution domain is  2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2  . The displacement along the whole boundary faces are prescribed in accordance with the exact solution given in Eq. (79). Five grids which consist of, respectively, 155, 593, 832, 1461 and 4593 nodes are employed to investigate the convergence and efficiency, and the results are plotted in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively. The same observation as that in the last example is obtained, that is, the proposed QC1 is the most accurate and efficient method with highest convergence rates among the five tested methods. LC1 is convergent but its accuracy in displacement and energy for the finest discretization is only on the order of   10   \u2212 3   and   10   \u2212 2   , respectively. In contrast, the corresponding errors of the proposed QC1 is on the order of   10   \u2212 5   and   10   \u2212 4   . Tremendous improvement in accuracy is achieved by QC1. ST15 and ST24 also show nice accuracy and convergence for this example, but it is still not as accurate as QC1 and of course they consume much more CPU time.    Fig. 15 compares   \u03c3   x y   stress fields of this problem. Once again, QC1 obtains quite smooth stress distribution whereas LC1 displays considerable oscillations. ST15 and ST24 also show smooth stress fields comparable to that of QC1, but consume more CPU time.  To further demonstrate the feasibility of using the proposed QC1 in real engineering problems, a trigeminal tube subject to internal pressure is examined as the last example. The geometry of the tube is shown in Fig. 16. Two meshes shown in Fig. 17 are considered. The coarse mesh is used by the proposed QC1 to run this example along with the other two one-point integration methods for the purpose of comparison. The fine mesh is used by the FEM software Abaqus to get a reference solution to this problem.    Fig. 18 compares   \u03c3   x x   stress fields of this problem. Even though the proposed QC1 uses the coarse mesh, it still results a very smooth stress field which is even smoother than that obtained by Abaqus using the fine mesh. In addition, the maximum stress and its location predicted by QC1 agree quite well with those given by Abaqus. In contrast, the other two one-point integration methods cannot get very smooth stress fields and thus they are totally wrong in the prediction of maximum stress point.   CONCLUSIONS   Quadratically consistent one-point (QC1) integration scheme has been developed for three-dimensional meshfree methods. It not only reduces the number of integration points to minimum, but also can exactly pass linear and quadratic patch tests and thus possesses second order exactness. This leads to its excellent performance in accuracy, convergence and efficiency as well as its impressive ability to give very accurate and smooth stress fields as demonstrated in the last section. This method is probably very useful for modeling three-dimensional crack propagation since fracture is driven by accurate stress fields and meanwhile, one-point integration provides certain convenience in cutting integration cells.  Other major findings are the following:  (1) The existing LC1 which is widely applied in three-dimensional meshfree modeling does have evident stabilization effect for direct one-point integration (ST1). However, its stabilization is not adequate for high order meshfree methods and thus spurious oscillations still may present in the stress fields. Besides, it cannot maintain the high accuracy and high convergence for high order meshfree methods.  Directly adding more evaluation points is not a good solution to the domain integration in 3D high order meshfree methods. It is not only unacceptable since plenty of CPU time are consumed, but also is ineffective to some extent since adding more integration points leads to marginal or even no improvement as demonstrated by the results of ST15 and ST24 in the last section.  Even though the high order meshfree approximant and its derivatives are very complicated in 3D and thus it is very difficult to accurately evaluate their domain integrals, this study demonstrates a promising way towards the solution of this difficulty. Although the developed method has certain drawbacks, it deserves consideration due to its perfect numerical performance.

REFERENCES", "highlights": "A stable and efficient integration scheme which evaluates the Galerkin weak form only at the centers of background tetrahedral elements (cells) for three-dimensional element-free Galerkin method with quadratic approximation is proposed. The derivation of the method is based on the Hu\u2013Washizu three-field variational principle and the orthogonality condition between stress and strain difference is satisfied by correcting the nodal derivatives at quadrature points with Taylor series expansion technique. The consistency of such corrected derivatives is theoretically proved. Numerical experiments validate that the proposed method can exactly pass linear and quadratic patch tests. Therefore, it is named as quadratically consistent one-point (QC1) integration. The superiority of the proposed QC1 than other integration schemes for three-dimensional element-free Galerkin methods in accuracy, convergence, efficiency and stability is sufficiently demonstrated by several 3D examples."}
