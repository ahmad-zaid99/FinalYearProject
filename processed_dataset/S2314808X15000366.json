The hybrid lattice equation with fractional order derivative is consider and found solution.      Frequency amplitude formula and chain rule for fractional derivative are utilized.          KEYPHRASES   Soliton  Differential-difference  Hybrid lattice   The concept of differential-difference equations (DDEs) [1] has been motivated because of their numerous applications in different areas of physics [2,3] and engineering [4]. An important contribution of DDEs is perceived in modeling complex physical phenomenon such as current flow in electrical networks and vibrations of particle in lattices. In many nonlinear studies, DDEs have gained much attention ever since the work of Fermi et\u00a0al. [5] in 1960s. Various conventional methods to acquire the solutions of nonlinear differential-difference equations (NDDEs) were presented in the theory of lattice-soliton [6,7], for instance, the bilinear form, symmetries [8], and some closed-form analytical solutions of several lattices in polynomial function of tanh [9]. A little attention was also devoted to obtain the closed-form solutions of NDDEs by using the symbolic computation. Baldwin et\u00a0al. [10] have proposed the tanh-approach to solve NDDEs. Discrete nonlinear lattices have gained a significant attention in numerous branches of science. A considerable literature has grown up around the theme of nonlinear lattice differential equations (NLDEs) becase of their use in physical and mathematical models of enormous real-world phenomena. Existing research recognizes the critical role played by discrete solitons in physical systems on very large scale, for example, biophysical systems, atomic chains with on-site cubic nonlinearities, electrical lattices, molecular crystals and recently in arrays of coupled nonlinear optical wave guides. Fractional order derivatives have also been the subject to describe several physical phenomena [11,12] such as diffusion processes, damping laws, rheology, and many other.  In this study, the fractional order transformation is used to transform the fractional differential-difference equation into ordinary differential-difference equation and then analyzed by frequency amplitude formulation [13\u201315]. It should be noted that the generalized hybrid lattice equation may be converted into discrete mKdV lattice and modified Volterra lattice equation for some particular cases. The proposed methodology allows us to precisely solve FDDEs with the support of symbolic computation.  The Riemann\u2013Liouville derivative of order \u03b1 is defined, for a function  H  ( x )   , by  (1)    D x \u03b1  H  ( x )  =  1  \u0393  (  \u2212 \u03b1  )      \u222b 0 x      (  x \u2212 \u03b7  )    \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 1    [  H  ( \u03b7 )  \u2212 H  ( 0 )   ]  d \u03b7    f o r  \u03b1 < 0 ,       (2)    D x \u03b1  H  ( x )  =  1  \u0393  (  1 \u2212 \u03b1  )     d  d x     \u222b 0 x      (  x \u2212 \u03b7  )    \u2212 \u03b1    [  H  ( \u03b7 )  \u2212 H  ( 0 )   ]  d \u03b7    f o r  0 < \u03b1 < 1 ,       (3)    D x \u03b1  H  ( x )  =    (   H   ( n )     ( x )   )     (  \u03b1 \u2212 n  )     f o r  n \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 n + 1 ,  n \u2265 1 ,    where  H : R \u2192 R  is a continuous function.  Using the properties of the Riemann Liouville derivative from [12], we have  (4)    D x \u03b1   x \u03b2  =   \u0393  (  1 + \u03b2  )    \u0393  (  1 + \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1  )     x  \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1   ,  \u03b2 > 0,       (5)    d \u03b1  x  ( t )  = \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )  d x  ( t )        In this section, a method is described to solve NDDEs directly. Let's suppose the FDDE in the form:  (6)      d \u03b1   u n   ( t )    d  t \u03b1    = F  (   u  n \u2212 1   ,  u n  ,  u  n + 1    )  ,  t > 0,  0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1    where   u n   is a dependent variable, and t is a continuous variable, and  n \u2208 Z  .  The main steps of this method are pr\u00e9cised as follows:   Step 1. Consider the FDDE as in Eq. (6)    Step 2. To find the exact solution of Eq. (6), introduce the variable transformation  Hence, Eq. (6) by using Eq. (5), can be written as:  (8)     d  u n    d \u03b7   =  1  \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    F  (   u  n \u2212 1   ,  u n  ,  u  n + 1    )         Step 3. Using the ancient Chinese algorithm (frequency amplitude formulation) initially applied to nonlinear oscillators in 2006 [16]; two test functions are selected in the forms:  The test functions are selected in a fashion:  (11)    u  n , 1    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  +  \u03c9 1  \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  +  \u03c9 1  \u03b7  )       \u03c9 1  = 1 ,       (12)    u  n , 2    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  +  \u03c9 2  \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  +  \u03c9 2  \u03b7  )       \u03c9 2  = \u03c9 .       Which should be compatible for   u n  ,  u  n \u2212 1    and   u  n + 1    ; Eqs. (11) and (12) are now given as:  (13)    u  n \u2212 1,1    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  \u2212 h + \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  \u2212 h + \u03b7  )            (14)    u  n + 1,1    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  + h + \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  + h + \u03b7  )            (15)    u  n \u2212 1,2    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  \u2212 h + \u03c9 \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  \u2212 h + \u03c9 \u03b7  )            (16)    u  n + 1,2    (  n , \u03b7  )  =  A   e   \u03be n  + h + \u03c9 \u03b7   +  e  \u2212  (   \u03be n  + h + \u03c9 \u03b7  )         where h is small increment in   \u03be n   .   Step 4. Define residual function  On utilizing Eq. (11)\u2013(16) into Eq. (8), the residual functions     R \u02dc   1   and     R \u02dc   2   can be achieved as:  (18)      R \u02dc   1   ( \u03b7 )  =   d  u  n , 1     d \u03b7   \u2212  1  \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    F  (   u  n \u2212 1,1   ,  u  n , 1   ,  u  n + 1,1    )        (19)      R \u02dc   2   ( \u03b7 )  =   d  u  n , 2     d \u03b7   \u2212  1  \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    G  (   u  n \u2212 1,2   ,  u  n , 2   ,  u  n + 1,2    )  ,        Step 5. Using frequency amplitude formulation the frequency of the nonlinear oscillator \u03c9 is assumed to be as follows:   Step 6. Equating each coefficient   e   \u03be n    ,  e  2  \u03be n    ,  e  3  \u03be n    , .  .  .  of the exponential equation to zero gives a set of algebraic equations for  \u03c9 , A  .   Step 7. The exact solutions for Eq. (6) can be obtained by substituting the obtained results into Eq. (11) and (12) with  \u03b7  =   t \u03b1   , by solving the algebraic equations found in step 6.  The well-known hybrid lattice equation with fractional order derivative can be written as  (21)      d \u03b1   u n    d  t \u03b1    =  (  \u03bb + \u03b2  u n  + \u03b3  u n 2   )   (   u  n \u2212 1   \u2212  u  n + 1    )  ,    where  \u03bb , \u03b2 , \u03b3 \u2260 0  are constants.  On utilizing the transformation  \u03b7 =  t \u03b1   in Eq. (21) yields  (22)     d  u n    d \u03b7   =  1  \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )     (  \u03bb + \u03b2  u n  + \u03b3  u n 2   )   (   u  n \u2212 1   \u2212  u  n + 1    )  ,       On following the steps 2\u20135 as mentioned in the previous section, with the help of a symbolic computer software Mathematica 8, Eq. (22) can be transformed as:  (23)   \u2212   A  (  \u2212  e  \u2212 \u03be   \u03c9 +  e \u03be  \u03c9  )       (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2    \u2212  \u03c9 2   (    A  (  \u2212  e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )       (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2    \u2212   A  (  \u2212  e  \u2212 \u03be   \u03c9 +  e \u03be  \u03c9  )       (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2     )  \u2212  \u03c9 2   (  \u2212   A  (  \u2212  e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )       (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2    \u2212    (   (   A   e  h \u2212 \u03be   +  e  \u2212 h + \u03be     \u2212  A   e  h + \u03be   +  e  \u2212 h \u2212 \u03be      )   (  \u03bb +   A \u03b2    e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be    +    A 2  \u03b3      (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2     )   )    \u0393  ( \u03b1 + 1 )     )  \u2212    (   A   e  h \u2212 \u03be   +  e  \u2212 h + \u03be     \u2212  A   e  h + \u03be   +  e  \u2212 h \u2212 \u03be      )   (  \u03bb +   A \u03b2    (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )    +    A 2  \u03b3      (   e  \u2212 \u03be   +  e \u03be   )   2     )    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    = 0       Considering  s =  e \u03be   yields  (24)     \u2212  (  A  e  \u2212 h    (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )   (  \u2212 \u03bb +  e  2 h   \u03bb +  e h  \u03c9 \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )   )  s  )    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    \u2212    A 2   e  \u2212 h    (  \u2212 1 +  e  2 h    )   (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )  \u03b2  s 2    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    +    (  A  e  \u2212 3 h    (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )   (  \u2212 \u03bb +  e  6 h   \u03bb +  A 2   e  2 h   \u03b3 \u2212  A 2   e  4 h   \u03b3 + 3  e  3 h   \u03c9 \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )   )   s 3   )    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    +    A 2   e  \u2212 3 h    (  \u2212 1 +  e  2 h    )     (  1 +  e  2 h    )   2   (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )  \u03b2  s 4    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    + ... = 0       Now, setting the coefficients of   s i   to be zero give  (25)      s 1  :    \u2212 A  e  \u2212 h    (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )   (  \u2212 \u03bb +  e  2 h   \u03bb +  e h  \u03c9 \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )   )    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    = 0      s 2  :    \u2212  A 2   e  \u2212 h    (  \u2212 1 +  e  2 h    )   (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )  \u03b2   \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    = 0      s 3  :    A  e  \u2212 3 h    (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )   (  \u2212 \u03bb +  e  6 h   \u03bb +  A 2   e  2 h   \u03b3 \u2212  A 2   e  4 h   \u03b3 + 3  e  3 h   \u03c9 \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )   )    \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    = 0      s 4  :     A 2   e  \u2212 3 h    (  \u2212 1 +  e  2 h    )     (  1 +  e  2 h    )   2   (  \u2212 1 +  \u03c9 2   )  \u03b2   \u0393  (  \u03b1 + 1  )    = 0         Now solving set of Eq.

The soliton-solution is proposed for fractional order DDE by a transformation and the Chinese algorithm. The closed-form solutions of has been obtained. It should be noted that the soliton solution of discrete mKdV lattice and modified Volterra lattice can be found by using particular values of  \u03b1 ,  \u03bb ,  \u03b2   and \u03b3 . This study also reveals that the symbolic computation software plays a vital role in finding the excact solution of DDEs. Moreover, this method may also be applicable for a system of DDEs and partial DDEs with fractional order derivatives. This method is the generalization of [17] and the solution can obtained for   0 < \u03b1 \u2264 1  .
