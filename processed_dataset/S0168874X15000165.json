The displacement function F is used to derive the trial functions of the elements.      The displacement fields can a priori satisfy all related governing equations.      The elements are quite insensitive to mesh distortions and free of shear-locking.      The displacement-based elements can provide high-precision results for resultants.          KEYPHRASES   Finite element  Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate  Displacement function  Generalized conforming  Mesh distortion   As a major class of finite element models, Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate bending elements have been extensively studied over the past few decades and numerous successful models were proposed [1\u201315]. Playing a central role in practical engineering analysis, the Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate element is continuously being improved for better performance and to meet specific requirement. Among others, some of the latest developments include the NIPE formulations derived from the assumed-strain technique [16], the models with continuous displacement and discontinuous rotations [17,18], the element based on the high-order linked interpolation [19], the alternative alpha finite element method with discrete shear gap technique [20], and so on. However, two major challenges remain outstanding: (1) the performance of the element cannot be guaranteed when the mesh is severely distorted; and (2) the precisions for stress/resultant results are relatively lower than those for displacements.  A series of new developments have been reported recently, which make it possible to address the aforementioned challenges. Liu et al. [21] proposed the smoothed FEM (SFEM), which integrates the strain smoothing technique into the conventional FEM and formulates different smoothed FEM models, including the cell-based SFEM [22,23], the edge-based SFEM [24] and the node-based SFEM [25]. The plate elements based on these SFEM models [26,27] are insensitive to mesh distortion and free of shear locking. Ribati\u0107 et al. [28] constructed two 9-node distortion-immune displacement-based quadrilateral thick plate elements by using bubble parameters. Cen et al. [29] proposed a hybrid displacement function (HDF) method for formulating Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate elements, where they took the displacement function F [30] to derive the stress trial functions that satisfy all governing equations and employed the Timoshenko\u2019s beam formulae to determine boundary displacement modes. The HDF element enables superior precision for both displacements and resultants, even in cases where a severely distorted mesh containing concave quadrilateral or degenerated triangular elements is used.  By combining the displacement function F [29,30] with the generalized conforming element method [1], this work develops two high-performance displacement-based Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate elements. The concept of the generalized conforming element was first proposed by Long et al. [31], and since then has been successfully applied to plane problems [32,33], plate problems [34\u201337] and shell problems [38] as well. In this concept, the displacement fields are usually determined by the relaxed compatibility requirements, i.e., the generalized conforming conditions.  The new generalized conforming elements are derived via three steps. First, the deflection and rotation fields within the element are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F, and the corresponding unknown coefficients are introduced. Next, the relations between these unknown coefficients and the element\u2019s nodal displacement DOFs are determined by employing a set of generalized compatibility conditions, from which the deflection and rotation fields can be expressed as functions of the element\u2019s nodal displacement DOFs. Finally, the new elements can be constructed following the principle of minimum potential energy. These two quadrilateral elements are denoted as GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1, respectively, indicating that they are \u201cGeneralized Conforming Plate element with 4 nodes and 12 or 14 displacement coefficients\u201d. Since the displacement components derived from the displacement function F can satisfy all related governing equations, these new elements also possess the advantages from analytical methods, as the HDF elements [29] do.  The performance of the new elements is assessed with standard benchmark examples. Numerical results show that these two new elements are free of shear locking, insensitive to mesh distortions, and can provide satisfactory results for most cases. Only a small deviation exists for thick plates under soft simply supported boundary conditions due to interelement incompatibility.  For a Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate (see Fig. 1), the transverse deflection w and the rotations \u03c8  x , \u03c8  y can be expressed by the displacement function F [30]:  (1)  w = F \u2212  D C    \u2207  2  F ,    \u03c8   x   =   \u2202 F   \u2202 x   ,    \u03c8   y   =   \u2202 F   \u2202 y   ,   in which F should satisfy the equation:  (2)  D   \u2207  2    \u2207  2  F = q .      Substitution of Eq. (1) into the strain\u2013displacement relations yields  (3)    \u03ba   x x   = \u2212     \u2202  2  F   \u2202   x  2    ,    \u03ba   y y   = \u2212     \u2202  2  F   \u2202   y  2    ,    \u03ba   x y   = \u2212 2     \u2202  2  F   \u2202 x \u2202 y   ,      (4)    \u03b3   x z   = \u2212  D C   \u2202  \u2202 x    (    \u2207  2  F  )  ,    \u03b3   y z   = \u2212  D C   \u2202  \u2202 y    (    \u2207  2  F  )  ,   where D and C denote the bending and shear stiffness of the plate.  The solutions of the deflection, rotations and strains can be readily derived from the fundamental analytical solutions of displacement function F [29]. For the general (homogeneous) part of F, the displacement components and strains are listed in Table 1. For the particular part corresponding to a plate subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse load q, the displacement components are  (5)    u  \u204e  =  {        w  \u204e          \u03c8   x   \u204e           \u03c8   y   \u204e        }  =  {       q  48 D    (    x  4  +   y  4   )  \u2212  q  4 C    (    x  2  +   y  2   )         q  12 D     x  3         q  12 D     y  3       }  ,   and the strains are  (6)    E  \u204e  =  {        \u03ba   x x   \u204e           \u03ba   y y   \u204e           \u03ba   x y   \u204e           \u03b3   x z   \u204e           \u03b3   y z   \u204e        }  =  {      \u2212  q  4 D     x  2        \u2212  q  4 D     y  2       0      \u2212  q  2 C   x       \u2212  q  2 C   y      }  .      Unlike the traditional generalized conforming elements or nonconforming elements, the deflection and rotation fields of the new elements are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F. For a generalized conforming 4-node quadrilateral element, as shown in Fig. 2, the displacement function F is set as the linear combination of its fundamental analytical solutions:  (7)  F =   F  0  +   F  \u204e  =  \u2211  i = 1  k     F   i   0     \u03b1   i    +   F  \u204e  ,   where k is the number of the fundamental analytical solutions for the general part of F 0, and \u03b1  i (i=1\u2212k) are the corresponding unknown coefficients. Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (1), the deflection and rotation fields within the element are obtained as  (8)  w =  \u2211  i = 1  k     w   i   0     \u03b1   i    +   w  \u204e  ,    \u03c8   x   =  \u2211  i = 1  k     \u03c8   x i   0     \u03b1   i    +   \u03c8   x   \u204e   ,    \u03c8   y   =  \u2211  i = 1  k     \u03c8   y i   0     \u03b1   i    +   \u03c8   y   \u204e   .      The displacements can be expressed in the following matrix form:  (9)  u =  [        w   1   0         w   2   0         w   3   0      \u22ef      w   k   0           \u03c8   x 1   0         \u03c8   x 2   0         \u03c8   x 3   0      \u22ef      \u03c8   x k   0           \u03c8   y 1   0         \u03c8   y 2   0         \u03c8   y 3   0      \u22ef      \u03c8   y k   0        ]   {        \u03b1   1           \u03b1   2           \u03b1   3        \u22ee        \u03b1   k        }  +  {        w  \u204e          \u03c8   x   \u204e           \u03c8   y   \u204e        }  = U \u03b1 +   u  \u204e  .      Then, the corresponding strain field can be obtained as  (10)  E =  [        \u03ba   x x 1         \u03ba   x x 2         \u03ba   x x 3      \u22ef      \u03ba   x x k           \u03ba   y y 1         \u03ba   y y 2         \u03ba   y y 3      \u22ef      \u03ba   y y k           \u03ba   x y 1         \u03ba   x y 2         \u03ba   x y 3      \u22ef      \u03ba   x y k           \u03b3   x z 1         \u03b3   x z 2         \u03b3   x z 3      \u22ef      \u03b3   x z k           \u03b3   y z 1         \u03b3   y z 2         \u03b3   y z 3      \u22ef      \u03b3   y z k        ]   {        \u03b1   1           \u03b1   2           \u03b1   3        \u22ee        \u03b1   k        }  +  {        \u03ba   x x   \u204e           \u03ba   y y   \u204e           \u03ba   x y   \u204e           \u03b3   x z   \u204e           \u03b3   y z   \u204e        }  =  E \u00af  \u03b1 +   E  \u204e  .      The detailed components of matrices U and  E \u00af  in the above equations are listed in Table 1.  In order to solve these unknown coefficients \u03b1  i (i=1\u2212k), it is necessary to introduce k generalized conforming conditions. After employing an appropriate set of generalized conforming conditions, the relations between the coefficients \u03b1  i (i=1\u2212k) and the element\u2019s nodal displacement DOFs are obtained as  (11)  \u03bb \u03b1 +   U  \u204e  = \u0393   q  e  ,   where  (12)    q  e  =   [        w   1         \u03c8   x 1         \u03c8   y 1         w   2         \u03c8   x 2         \u03c8   y 2         w   3         \u03c8   x 3         \u03c8   y 3         w   4         \u03c8   x 4         \u03c8   y 4        ]  T  .      The matrices \u03bb, U \u204e and \u0393 have different expressions for different sets of generalized conforming conditions. The details for this matter will be discussed in Section 2.3.  Following Eq. (11), \u03b1 can be expressed in terms of q  e :  (13)  \u03b1 =   L   \u03bb     q  e  \u2212   L   u   ,   where  (14)    L   \u03bb   =   \u03bb   \u2212 1   \u0393 ,    L   u   =   \u03bb   \u2212 1     U  \u204e  .      Then, substitution of Eq. (13) into Eqs. (9) and (10) yields  (15)  u = U  (    L   \u03bb     q  e  \u2212   L   u    )  +   u  \u204e  = N   q  e  +   N  \u204e  ,      (16)  E =  E \u00af   (    L   \u03bb     q  e  \u2212   L   u    )  +   E  \u204e  = B   q  e  +   B  \u204e  ,   in which  (17)  N = U   L   \u03bb   ,    N  \u204e  =   u  \u204e  \u2212 U   L   u   ,      (18)  B =  E \u00af    L   \u03bb   ,    B  \u204e  =   E  \u204e  \u2212  E \u00af    L   u   .      The potential energy functional of a Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate element can be expressed in the following matrix form [1]:  (19)    \u03a0   P   e   =  \u222c    A  e      1 2    E  T  AE d x d y  \u2212  \u222c    A  e       f  T  u d x d y  +  \u222b    S   \u03c3   e         R \u00af   T   d \u00af  d s  ,   where A is the elasticity matrix as defined in Eq. (20), f is the distributed transverse load vector within the plate as defined in Eq. (21),  R \u00af  is the boundary load vector at the element\u2019s edge as defined in Eq. (22), and  d \u00af  is the boundary displacement along the boundary   S   \u03c3   e   as defined in Eq. (23).  (20)  A =  [     D    \u03bc D    0   0   0      \u03bc D    D   0   0   0     0   0      1 \u2212 \u03bc  2  D    0   0     0   0   0   C   0     0   0   0   0   C     ]  ,      (21)  f =   [     q   0   0     ]  T  ,      (22)   R \u00af  =   [      \u2212  T \u00af         M \u00af    n          M \u00af    n s        ]  T  ,      (23)   d \u00af  =    {      w \u00af          \u03c8 \u00af    n            \u03c8 \u00af    s        }  |     S   \u03c3   e     =  [     1              l   m         \u2212 m    l     ]     {      w \u00af          \u03c8 \u00af    x            \u03c8 \u00af    y        }  |     S   \u03c3   e     = Lu   |     S   \u03c3   e     ,   where l, m denote the direction cosines of the element boundaries\u2019 outer normal n.  By substituting Eqs. (15) and (16) into Eq. (19) and applying the principle of minimum potential energy,  (24)    \u2202   \u03a0   P   e     \u2202   q  e    =  \u222c    A  e       B  T  AB d x d y    q  e  +  \u222c    A  e       B  T  A   B  \u204e  d x d y  \u2212  \u222c    A  e       N  T  f d x d y  +  \u222b     S   \u03c3   e       N |     S   \u03c3   e     T     L  T   R \u00af  d s  = 0 ,   the following relation can be obtained:  (25)  K   q  e  =   p  e  ,   where K is the element stiffness matrix  (26)  K =  \u222c    A  e       B  T  AB d x d y  ,   and p  e is the element nodal equivalent load vector  (27)    p  e  =  \u222c    A  e       N  T  f d x d y  \u2212  \u222c    A  e       B  T  A   B  \u204e  d x d y  \u2212  \u222b    S   \u03c3   e        N |     S   \u03c3   e     T     L  T   R \u00af  d s  ,   where N   |     S   \u03c3   e     is the value of N along the boundary   S   \u03c3   e   .  The unknown coefficient \u03b1 can be derived from Eq. (13) after solving for q  e . Then the displacements and the strains at any point of the element can be determined by substituting its Cartesian coordinates into Eqs. (9) and (10).  The above derivation shows the general formulations for constructing new generalized conforming elements. If different generalized conforming conditions are employed for deriving the elements, the detailed expressions of related matrices (see from Eqs. (14)\u2013(18)) will also be different.  In this section, two new generalized conforming plate (GCP) elements are constructed following the procedure described in Section 2.2. According to the number of the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F being used, these two elements are denoted by GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1, respectively.  As shown in Fig. 2, for the element GCP4-12\u03b1, the displacement function F (see Eq. (7)) is assumed to be the linear combination of its first 12 terms of fundamental analytical solutions (see Table 1). Then, k in Eqs. (7\u201310) equals 12. To determine these coefficients \u03b1  i (i=1\u201312), 12 generalized conforming conditions must be employed.  First, the following nodal compatibility conditions for deflection are considered:  (28)  w  (    x   j   ,   y   j    )  =   w   j   ,   (  j = 1 \u2212 4  )  ,   where (x  j , y  j ), (j=1\u20134), are the Cartesian coordinates of the node j, w(x  j , y  j ) is calculated by using Eq. (9), and as one of the element\u2019s DOFs, w  j is the deflection at the node j.   Next, the point compatibility conditions are considered for normal rotations at two Gauss points A  i and B  i (the local parametric coordinates are \u00b1 1 /  3  , respectively) along each edge:  (29)    \u03c8   n    (    x   k   ,   y   k    )  =    \u03c8 \u00af    n k   ,   (  k =   A   1   ,   B   1   ,   A   2   ,   B   2   ,   A   3   ,   B   3   ,   A   4   ,   B   4    )  ,   where \u03c8  n (x  k , y  k ) are also calculated by substituting the Cartesian coordinates into Eq. (9), and    \u03c8 \u00af    n k   are determined by the boundary normal rotations    \u03c8 \u00af    n   varying linearly along the edge ij:  (30)     \u03c8 \u00af    n i j   =  (  1 \u2212 s  )     \u03c8 \u00af    n i   + s    \u03c8 \u00af    n j   ,   (  s = 0 \u2212 1  )  .   where    \u03c8 \u00af    n i   and    \u03c8 \u00af    n j   are the normal rotations at the node i, j along the edge ij.  Substituting Eqs. (7\u201310) into Eqs. (28\u201330), the matrices in Eq. (11) can be obtained for the element GCP4-12\u03b1.

Then, by substituting the matrices \u03bb, U \u204e and \u0393 (see Eqs. (31\u201340)) into the equations discussed in Section 2.2, the expressions of the stiffness matrix and the nodal equivalent load vector for the element GCP4-12\u03b1 can be obtained.  For the element GCP4-14\u03b1 (see Fig. 2), the displacement function F is formed by the first 14 terms of its fundamental analytical solutions (see Table 1).  To determine the unknown coefficients \u03b1  i (i=1\u201314), fourteen generalized conforming conditions are needed. Besides those conditions used for the element GCP4-12\u03b1, two additional compatibility conditions are considered:  (41)  w (   x   5   ,   y   5   ) + w (   x   7   ,   y   7   ) =   w   5   +   w   7   w (   x   6   ,   y   6   ) + w (   x   8   ,   y   8   ) =   w   6   +   w   8   ,   where (x  j , y  j ) (j=5\u20138) are the Cartesian coordinates of the mid-side points 5\u20138 at each element edge, and w  j (j=5\u22128) are the deflections at these mid-side points. The deflections w  j (j=5\u20138) are determined by using the locking-free formulae of Timoshenko\u2019s beam [29]:  (42)     w \u00af    i j   = [ 1 \u2212 s + ( 1 \u2212 2   \u03b4   i j   )   Z   3   ]   w   i   + [ s \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 2   \u03b4   i j   )   Z   3   ]   w   j   +     l   i j    2  [   Z   2   + ( 1 \u2212 2   \u03b4   i j   )   Z   3   ]   \u03c8   s i   \u2212     l   i j    2  [   Z   2   \u2212 ( 1 \u2212 2   \u03b4   i j   )   Z   3   ]   \u03c8   s j   ,   in which  (43)    Z   2   = s ( 1 \u2212 s ) ,    Z   3   = s ( 1 \u2212 s ) ( 1 \u2212 2 s ) ,    \u03b4   i j   =   6   \u03bb   i j     1 + 12   \u03bb   i j     ,    \u03bb   i j   =  D  C   l   i j   2     ,   where D and C denote the bending and shear stiffness, respectively; and l  ij is the edge length. For these mid-side points 5\u20138, s equals 1/2.  Then, by substituting Eqs. (7\u201310) into these fourteen generalized conforming conditions (see Eqs. (28)\u2013(30) and (41)\u2013(43)), the details of matrices in Eq. (11) can be obtained. Specifically, the matrix \u03bb is given by  (44)  \u03bb =  [     W        \u03c6   n           W   m i d        ]  ,   where W and \u03c6  n share the same for as in Eq. (31), and W  mid is obtained as  (45)    W   m i d   =  [        w   1   0    (    x   5   ,   y   5    )  +   w   1   0    (    x   7   ,   y   7    )        w   2   0    (    x   5   ,   y   5    )  +   w   2   0    (    x   7   ,   y   7    )     \u22ef      w   14   0    (    x   5   ,   y   5    )  +   w   14   0    (    x   7   ,   y   7    )          w   1   0    (    x   6   ,   y   6    )  +   w   1   0    (    x   8   ,   y   8    )        w   2   0    (    x   6   ,   y   6    )  +   w   2   0    (    x   8   ,   y   8    )     \u22ef      w   14   0    (    x   6   ,   y   6    )  +   w   14   0    (    x   8   ,   y   8    )       ]  .      The matrix U \u204e is  (46)    U  \u204e  =  [        W  \u204e          \u03c6   n   \u204e           W   m i d   \u204e        ]  ,   where W \u204e and   \u03c6   n   \u204e   are the same as Eq. (35), and   W   m i d   \u204e   is obtained as:  (47)    W   m i d   \u204e   =  [        w  \u204e   (    x   5   ,   y   5    )  +   w  \u204e   (    x   7   ,   y   7    )          w  \u204e   (    x   6   ,   y   6    )  +   w  \u204e   (    x   8   ,   y   8    )       ]  .      The matrix \u0393 is  (48)  \u0393 =  [        \u0393   w           \u0393   \u03c6           \u0393   w   \u204e        ]  ,   where \u0393  w and \u0393  \u03c6 are the same as Eq. (38), and   \u0393   w   \u204e   is obtained as  (49)    \u0393   w   \u204e   =  [       1 2      \u2212  1 8    x   12       \u2212  1 8    y   12        1 2       1 8    x   12        1 8    y   12        1 2      \u2212  1 8    x   34       \u2212  1 8    y   34        1 2       1 8    x   34        1 8    y   34          1 2       1 8    x   41        1 8    y   41        1 2      \u2212  1 8    x   23       \u2212  1 8    y   23        1 2       1 8    x   23        1 8    y   23        1 2      \u2212  1 8    x   41       \u2212  1 8    y   41        ]  ,   where   x   i j   =   x   i   \u2212   x   j   ,   y   i j   =   y   i   \u2212   y   j   .  Thus, the stiffness matrix and the nodal equivalent load vector for the element GCP4-14\u03b1 can be readily obtained. Since the element GCP4-14\u03b1 uses 14 terms of fundamental analytical solutions, which guarantees the completeness of the displacement function up to the fourth order, it performs better than the element GCP4-12\u03b1 in distorted meshes.  Several benchmark examples are employed to assess the new elements GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1. In order to clearly illustrate the performance, the results from some well-known Mindlin\u2013Reissner plate elements are also provided for comparison, including MITC4 [2,27], Q4BL [10], ARS-Q12 [14], RDKMQ [15], MISC2 [27], AC-MQ4 [37], S4R [39], CRB1 [40], CRB2 [40], S1 [40], DKQ [41], 9\u03b2Q4 [42], MiSP4 [43], MMiSP4 [43], MiSP4+ [44] and DKMQ [45].  The model and the mesh used for the patch test are shown in Fig. 3a together with the parameter settings. Three cases with different span\u2013thickness ratios (2a/h=1000, 100, 20) are considered, where 2a is the length of the longer edge and h is the plate\u2019s thickness.  (a) Displacement loading case  In this case, the deflections and rotations at the outer nodes 1\u20134 are applied to the patch as the boundary conditions, and their values at the inner nodes 5\u20138 will be evaluated.  For the constant bending state, the exact displacement fields are given by [28]   (50)  w =   (  1 + x + 2 y +   x  2  +   y  2   )  2  ,    \u03c8   x   =   (  1 + 2 x  )  2  ,    \u03c8   y   =   (  2 + 2 y  )  2  .      Both GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1 can provide exact solutions in all span\u2013thickness ratio cases (2a/h=1000, 100, 20).  For the constant twisting state, the exact displacement fields are given by [28]   (51)  w =   (  1 + x + 2 y + x y  )  2  ,    \u03c8   x   =   (  1 + y  )  2  ,    \u03c8   y   =   (  2 + x  )  2  .      In case 2a/h=1000, both new elements can pass the test exactly. In case 2a/h=100, the maximum relative percentage errors of elements GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1 are 0.078% and 0.074%, respectively, and increase to 1.73% and 2.05% in case 2a/h=20. These errors are mainly caused by the interelement incompatibilities in a coarse mesh. With the refinement of the mesh, these errors will vanish rapidly.  For the constant shear deformation state, the exact displacement fields are [46]   (52)  w =   (  x + y  )  2  ,    \u03c8   x   =   \u2212 1  2  ,    \u03c8   y   =   \u2212 1  2  .      This test is significant only for the thick plate with a very large thickness in which only shear energy works. The element GCP4-14\u03b1 can exactly pass this test, while the maximum relative percentage error of GCP4-12\u03b1 is 6.0%.  Constant bending moment loading case (M  n =1)   Fig. 3b shows this loading case in which the plate is subjected to moments along its all edges. The equivalent nodal forces are also given in Fig. 3b. In this case, the bending moments M  x =1 and M  y =1, while other resultants are equal to zero. For all different span\u2013thickness ratios (2a/h=1000, 100, 20), both GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1 can exactly pass this patch test.  Constant twisting moment loading case (M  xy =1)  As shown in Fig. 3c, the plate is subjected to twisting moment along its all edges. The equivalent nodal forces, derived from the assumption that the plate\u2019s edge behaves like a locking-free Timoshenko\u2019s beam [29], are also given in Fig. 3c. In this case, the twisting moments M  xy =1, while other resultants are equal to zero. When 2a/h=1000, both two new elements can pass the test exactly. For the ratio 2a/h=100, the maximum relative percentage errors of the elements GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1 are 2.12% and 1.70%, respectively. And for the ratio 2a/h=20, they increase to 3.24% and 2.80%.  Constant shear resultant loading case (T  x =1)  As stated in Section 3.1(a), this test is significant only for the thick plate limit [45]. Fig. 3d shows the cantilever plate, with a very large value of thickness h, is subjected to a distributed line shear force at the free edge (replaced by two concentrated nodal forces). The value of shear force T  x should equal 1. The element GCP4-14\u03b1 can exactly pass this test, while the maximum relative percentage error of GCP4-12\u03b1 is 2.62%.  Some discussions  From above tests, it can be observed that, for the thin plate (2a/h=1000), both new elements can provide exact solutions. However, small errors may appear when the thickness increases for constant twisting moment cases. These errors are mainly caused by the interelement incompatibilities, and can be eliminated by using a refiner mesh. Since the element GCP4-14\u03b1 employs two more trial functions, it indeed exhibits better performance. As described in previous sections, these two elements belong to the nonconforming model in a coarse mesh, and will converge into conforming models when the mesh is refined. Thus, the convergence can still be guaranteed.  The square plate is subjected to a uniformly distributed load, as shown in Fig. 4. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled. The edge length and thickness are denoted by L and h, respectively. Poisson\u2019s ratio \u03bc is set as 0.3. Three cases with different boundary conditions are considered: the clamped case (w=0, \u03c8  n =0, \u03c8  s =0), the soft simply supported (SS1) case (w=0), and the hard simply supported (SS2) case (w=0, \u03c8  s =0).         Tables 2\u20137 give the dimensionless central deflections and moments of the plate for two ratios (h/L=0.001, 0.1), which are calculated by using the regular mesh (see Fig. 4a). For comparison, results obtained by some other quadrilateral elements [2,10,14,27,37] are also presented. To visually show the convergences, the corresponding plots using log scale are given in   Figs. 5\u20137. Furthermore, the results calculated by using the distorted meshes (see Fig. 4b) are also plotted in Fig. 8. In these figures, the relative errors are defined as follows:  (53)    e   w   =   |  w \u2212   w   r e f    |   |    w   r e f    |   ,    e   M   =   |  M \u2212   M   r e f    |   |    M   r e f    |   .      Note, because the number of the significant digits for the reference solutions is only four, the low bound of the relative error is about 10\u22125.  It can be seen that, in most cases, these two elements can provide good results, especially for thin plate cases. But for the SS1 thick plate case, they may converge to a slightly stiffer solution. This problem is mainly caused by the interelement incompatibility. Since the errors are only 1%, the results are still in an acceptable range for engineering applications. An interesting feature is that the results obtained by these two new elements are entirely in agreement with each other in the regular meshes.    Fig. 9 shows a clamped thin square plate (h/L=0.001) subjected to a uniformly distributed load. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled by a coarse mesh (2\u00d72). Two distortion cases are considered: the symmetric case and the asymmetric case. In the symmetric case, the central mesh node is moved along the main diagonal of the plate to the corner node. In the asymmetric case, the central mesh node is moved to a plate edge along the direction parallel to another plate edge.  The normalized results obtained by the new elements and some other elements [2,27,39\u201341] are plotted in Fig. 10. The results show that the proposed elements are quite insensitive to the mesh distortion, and the element GCP4-14\u03b1 performs more stably. It should be noted that, in the symmetric case, when the absolute value of the distortion parameter \u0394 reaches or exceeds 1.25, one element will degenerate into a triangle or a concave quadrangle. Under these situations, the new elements can still perform well, while most other elements fail to provide a solution.  As shown in Fig. 11, a clamed cantilever plate [42], which is subjected to a tip load P=0.5, is modeled by two elements. The material parameters are E=10.92 and \u03bc=0.3. The thickness and width are h=0.01 and L=1, respectively. The mesh distortion is measured by the parameter \u0394. Fig. 12 shows the percentage deviations of the transverse tip displacement at node C obtained by different elements [14,40,42]. This test proves again that the two new elements are more insensitive to the mesh distortion than others.  These two tests sufficiently show the robustness of the new elements in distorted meshes. It can also be found that the element GCP4-14\u03b1 exhibits a more outstanding performance, since its trial functions are derived from the displacement function with up to the fourth order completeness.  The Razzaque 60\u00b0 skew plate [47] (h/L=0.001) is subjected to a uniformly distributed load, as shown in Fig. 13. The transverse deflection w and the bending moment M  y at the central node C are calculated. Results obtained by the new elements and others [2,14,15,27,43\u201345] are plotted in Fig. 14. The results show that the new elements can produce good results for both deflections and bending moments.  The circular plate subjected to a uniformly distributed load q=1 is shown in Fig. 15. Due to symmetry, only a quarter of the plate is modeled. The geometrical parameters and material parameters are also given in Fig. 15. Two different thickness\u2013radius ratio cases (h/R=0.02, 0.2) and two different boundary condition cases (the SSl BC case and the clamped BC case) are analyzed. The normalized center deflection and moments are listed in  Tables 8 and 9. Fig. 16 shows the distributions of bending moments M  r , M  \u03b8 and shear force T  r along the radius of the clamped circular plate calculated by using 48 elements. It can be observed in Fig. 16 that the two new elements can provide resultants which are in good agreement with the exact solutions [43,44], while most conventional displacement-based models fail.   CONCLUSIONS   Two generalized conforming plate elements GCP4-12\u03b1 and GCP4-14\u03b1, whose trial functions are derived from the analytical solutions of the displacement function [29,30,48], are proposed in this paper. The generalized conforming technique relaxes the requirements of compatibility while improving the element performances. Since the displacement and strain fields of the new elements are assumed according to the fundamental analytical solutions of the displacement function F, which satisfy a priori all related governing equations, these new elements possess the advantages from analytical methods. Some benchmarks are employed to assess the performance of these new elements. In most cases, these two new elements can both provide rather good results, especially for thin plate cases. But for the thick plate under SS1 boundary condition, the result may converge to a slightly stiffer solution. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the interelement incompatibility. Since the error is only about 1%, those results are still in an acceptable range for engineering applications.
