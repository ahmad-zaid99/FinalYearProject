Cyanophyceae was the most dominant group at the studied khors.      Protein represents the main biochemical content, which reflects a healthy phytoplankton with high relative growth rates.      Winter was the optimum season for the measured biochemical contents; concurrently with high nitrate value.      High significant variation (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) was found between the four khors according to the studied phytoplankton biochemical parameters during winter.          KEYPHRASES   Khors of Lake Nasser  Phytoplankton  Chlorophyll a       Proteins  Carbohydrates  Lipids   Lake Nasser was high water quality and faces no threat of degradation due to local sources [1]. The shoreline of Lake Nasser is very irregular, with embayments called khors. There are about 85 long khors, 48 are on the east side and 37 on the west side. The existence of the khors increases greatly the length of the shore (8700\u2009km), the mean length of the khors increases downstream from south to north and all are U-shaped in cross section. The khors surface area covers about 4900\u2009km2 (79% of total lake surface); while their volume is 86.4\u2009km3, i.e. 55% of the total lake volume [2,3]. Some khors as Kalabsha, El-Allaqi and Tushka are wide, with a sandy bottom and slope gently; others as El-Sabakha, Singari and Korosko are steep, relatively narrow with a rocky bottom [4].  Algae can be used in the ecological risk assessment (ERA) to determine whether a problem exists, to infer levels of specific stressors in a targeted habitat within the water body [5]. Several factors can contribute to the nutritional value of microalgae, including its size and shape, digestibility (related to cell wall structure and composition), biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates and lipids) and the requirements of the animal feeding on the algae. Several studies have attempted to correlate the nutritional value of microalgae to their chemical profile [6,7].  Phytoplankton serve as food for zooplankton which in turn serve as food to almost all larval forms (either meroplanktononic or holoplanktonic) in natural surface water [8]. It is widely known that the addition of microalgae to larval fish culture tanks confers a number of benefits, such as preventing bumping against the walls of the tanks [9], enhancing predation of zooplankton [10], enhancing the nutritional value of zooplankton [11], as well as improving larval digestive [12] and immune functions [13] and as important source of fish oil lipids (polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) and all the essential amino acids [14\u201317]. Cyanobacteria (especially Microcystis sp.) are an important constituent of Nile tilapia diet in Lake Victoria [18].  The aim of this study is to explore, analyze and assess the quantitative and qualitative estimations of phytoplankton biochemical contents at the main khors of Lake Nasser (Tushka, Wadi-Abyad, Kalabsha and Korosko) in relation to the biological environmental conditions.   MATERIAL AND METHODS   Sampling was carried out seasonally from February 2013 to November 2013 from four selected khors in Lake Nasser (Fig.\u00a01 and Table\u00a01 ). Two northern (Kalabsha and Wadi-Abyad with 7 and 6 sites, respectively), and two southern (Khor Tushka, 6 sites) and (Khor Korosko, 8 sites). The sampling program was undertaken through National Institute of Oceanography and Fisheries (NIOF) in order to study environmental conditions and Fisheries of Lake Nasser.  Water temperature, pH and electric conductivity (EC) were measured by Multiprob Hydrolab (Model CRISON-Spain), transparency was measured by Secchi Disc, dissolved oxygen (DO) and nutrients, nitrogen (NO2 and NO3) and phosphorus PO4 were estimated by using the standard methods [19].  Lugol-preserved subsamples were dispensed into glass Sedgwick-Rafter cells and examined using IB2FL inverted microscope. Species composition and dominance in the samples were determined semi-quantitatively [20\u201322]. The main references used in phytoplankton identification were [23\u201331].  A known volume of water sample were collected by plastic bottles from the chosen sites, then sieved and filtered through zooplankton net (100\u2009\u00b5m mesh size) to separate macrozooplankton. Defined volume of the filtered water was re-filtered on Whatman GF/F (0.7\u2009\u00b5m pore diameter) fiber circles and the samples were transferred to the laboratory in ice tanks to determine the biochemical parameters of the separated phytoplankton. Chlorophyll a values were analyzed by Trichromatic equation [32]. Total protein content was determined by Biuret method [33]. Carbohydrate contents were measured and compared with glucose as a reference sugar according to Phenol-sulphuric acid method [34]. Whereas total lipid content was determined by the Sulphophosphovanillin procedure (SPV) using cholesterol as standard [35].  Correlation coefficient (r) was performed using Microsoft Excel 2013 to estimate the relation between chlorophyll a and the three biochemical parameters (proteins, lipids and carbohydrates) in order to verify the correlation between different variables. Two-way ANOVA was employed to evaluate the variability of the concentration of each biochemical parameters with respect to the studied khors during different seasons, probabilities less than (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) were considered statistically significant variation by SAS, version 9.1 (2004).   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION   Microalgae respond to physicochemical variations in the surrounding environment, but the nature and extent of such environmental interactions is not yet fully understood. There were noticeable changes in water properties between the four studied khors along the four seasons (Table\u00a02 ); the maximum temperature was found in summer and the minimum was detected in winter. Temperature is one of the most important environmental factors that affects microalgae growth rate, cell size, biochemical composition and nutrient requirements [36]. Increased temperature leads to degradation of the starch produced through \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucan phosphorylase enzymes and reduces protein synthesis thus consequently decreased growth rates of algae [37,38]. Alkaline pH levels ranged between 7.9 and 9 and electric conductivity between 191\u2013237\u2009\u00b5s cm\u22121 in the studied khors. Hydrogen ion concentration (pH) is one of the most important factors in algal cultivation since it determines the solubility and availability of CO2 and essential nutrients thus has a significant impact on algal metabolism, maximum algal growth occurs around neutral pH [39]. High transparency (385\u2009Cm) was observed in Wadi-Abyad, transparency of the Lake Nasser is affected by development of phytoplankton [40]. The studied four khors were highly oxygenated, during winter dissolved oxygen concentrations fluctuated from 5.8 to 12.1\u2009mg/l which may be due to high photosynthetic rate [41].  Winter was the optimum season for the measured biochemical parameters at the selected khors (Table\u00a03 ), except for Khor Kalabsha lipids were high in summer, concurrently nitrate recorded the highest value in winter 556 to 1738\u2009\u00b5g/l [42]. Some algae such as green algae and diatoms showed a trend to perform better at lower temperatures [43]. Low light levels in winter produced an increase in the amount of chlorophyll per unit biovolume [44]. The increase in the proportion of carbon incorporated in protein was observed when the temperature decreased in many algal cells [45]. Lipids were inhibited by high temperature [46,47]. Thermodiaptomus galebi, the most dominant adult form of Copepoda at Khor Wadi-Abyad, was highly noticed in winter with an average of 2746\u2009Org. m\u22123. Winter was the optimum season for the flourishing of Bosmina longirostris (5167\u2009Org. m\u22123) which represented about 44.8% of total Cladocera [48]. Zooplankton exhibits seasonal changes in both species composition, and biomass has been attributed to changes in phytoplankton biochemical composition [49]. Sarotherdon galielas, Oreochromis niloticus and Alestes dentex fish were collected from different sites during the study period exhibiting higher muscle contents of protein and lipid in winter [50]. During the study period, Cyanophyceae represented the dominant group. Phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria is an important diet item to the Nile tilapia in both Lake Mburo and Lake Victoria in Uganda, East Africa [18,51]. Algal lipids are nutritionally valuable essential fatty acids (FAs) which is important in larval fish nutrition as a major source of metabolic energy during the embryonic and pre-feeding fish larval stages [52,53].  High chlorophyll a concentration of 179.42\u2009mg/l was detected at site 1 of Khor Tushka (Fig.\u00a02 ), this result is related to the increase of phytoplankton biomass (144.4\u2009mgC l\u22121) at the same region [54]. At Khor Wadi-Abyad site 2 attained the optimum chlorophyll a, proteins and biomass (110.05\u2009mg/l, 5.95\u2009g/l and 97.0\u2009mgC l\u22121), which may be the reason of the peak of zooplankton crop (63,667\u2009Org. m\u22123) at the same site [48]. Microalgae can be used to produce a wide range of metabolites such as proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and vitamins for live feed of bivalve molluscs, zooplankton and some fish species [55]. Site 7 of Khor Kalabsha exceeded the other sites in chlorophyll a corresponding with the elevation of measured phytoplankton biomass of 210.4\u2009mgC l\u22121. While, there was a noticeable regional change at Khor Korosko in quantitative biochemical composition where site 1 obtained higher carbohydrates and biomass (48.7\u2009mg/l and 374.1\u2009mgC l\u22121) than the other selected sites (Fig.\u00a02).  Cyanophyceae was the most dominant group at the studied khors, where Microcystis aeruginosa, Microcystis flos-aquae, Lyngbya limnetica, Microcystis wesenbergii and Merismopedia glauca were the most dominant species. Blue green algae store reserved food materials which are the source of pigments, lipids, vitamins and proteins [56]. By comparing the studied khors according to their phytoplankton biochemical composition, Khor Korosko recorded the highest nutritive characters of proteins (6.6\u2009g/l), carbohydrates (14.2\u2009mg/l) and lipids (4.45\u2009mg/l) as shown in Fig.\u00a03 which may be the reason of the highly presence of Cladocera (Bosmina longrostris and Daphnia longispina) than the other khors [48]. Khor Korosko exhibited the highest productivity rate, phytoplankton diversity and evenness values than khors Kalabsha and Tushka [57,58]. Carbohydrates have been shown to be significantly higher in cells and sheaths of colonial Microcystis aeruginosa [59]. Total lipid reached 20% in Lyngbya limnetica [60]. Strain of Microcystis in single cells or small colonies is a good food for Daphnia obtuse and D. Hyaline, they can survive well even during cyanobacteria blooms [61,62]. Positive correlation was observed between the total zooplankton abundance and relative abundance of both Cladocera and cyanobacteria [8,63]. On the contrary, Khor Korosko attained the lowest chlorophyll a values of 71.4\u2009mg/l, while the maximum concentration (130.5\u2009mg/l) was found at Khor Kalabsha (Fig.\u00a03). Chlorophyll a content of algal cells is influenced by external and internal factors as nutrient concentrations, light factor, algal growth, species composition and cell size [64]. Accumulation of fatty acids was accompanied by decline in chlorophyll content in the green microalga Parietochloris incisa [65].  The present data revealed that protein represents the main phytoplankton biochemical content in the studied khors, while lipid was the minor. Protein generally reflects a physiologically healthy phytoplankton with high relative growth rates, and high protein contents suggesting that the phytoplankton had no nitrogen limitation in water mass [66]. High incorporation of carbon into proteins and low incorporation into lipids were a characteristic pattern of the photosynthetic allocations of phytoplankton throughout the euphotic zone which could provide nitrogen-sufficient food for the highest benthic faunal biomass [67].  In the present study, a highly positive correlation was detected between chlorophyll a and total protein content in khors Wadi-Abyad and Korosko (r\u2009=\u20090.753 and 0.716). Flu-like proteins (FLP) act as regulators of chlorophyll synthesis, and their expression is controlled by environmental changes and plastid signals [68,69]. Khor Korosko attained a positive moderate relationship between chlorophyll a and carbohydrates (r\u2009=\u20090.528). Also chlorophyll a had a positive relation with total carbohydrate and protein at Khor Tushka (r\u2009=\u20090.518 and 0.577). The relation between the biochemical contents and chlorophyll a of microalgae had been attempted by correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.99 [70]. Table\u00a04 showed significant variation (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) in phytoplankton biochemical parameters between the four selected khors during the four seasons, except protein during spring and summer, carbohydrate and lipid contents during autumn. There was a significant variation between phytoplankton biochemical contents according to seasonal period and geographic area [71].  The results suggest that the interaction effects of environmental factors, various nutrients and phytoplankton biochemical structure are all important to attain a thorough understanding of the behavior of microalgae in khors systems of Lake Nasser. Ethiopian Renaissance Dam could also lead to a permanent lowering of water level in Lake Nasser; therefore by the new measured data, we could predict the effect of Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on some biological parameters of Lake Nasser. Continuous research will not only lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of algae-water systems, basic algal cell biology and composition but it will also aid in a good selection of algal species to support the aquaculture industry. Live microalgae cultured from Khor Korosko in winter with high nutritive value and appropriate physical properties could provide a healthy rearing environment for the improvement and development of fish production at Lake Nasser.

Khor Korosko recorded the highest nutritive characters of phytoplankton proteins, carbohydrates and lipids (6.6\u2009g/l, 14.2 and 4.45\u2009mg/l), contrary to chlorophyll a which attained the least value of 71.4\u2009mg/l. Winter was the optimum season for the measured biochemical contents; concurrently with high nitrate value. Flourishing of Copepoda and Cladocera in winter and highly fish muscle contents of protein and lipid at the same time may be attributed to the elevation of the biochemical contents of microalgae. High significant variation (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.05) was found between the four khors according to the studied phytoplankton biochemical parameters during winter."}
